  title: "Monitoring Liquidity",
  tagline: "Closes Session 10 with the formal vocabulary for monitoring cash flows over time — a dense alphabet soup of 'term structure of X' concepts describing one idea: lay out expected cash flows date by date and check if the cumulative position ever goes negative.",

  teaches: `<p>Cash flow taxonomy, liquidity options, three components of liquidity risk, liquidity generation capacity (LGC), and the full family of term structures (TSECF/TSECCF, TSLGC/TSCLGC, TSAA, TSLaR).</p>`,

  why: `<p>A negative cumulated cash flow at some future date is a precursor to insolvency — this is the single most important number a Treasury department watches. This reading gives you the precise vocabulary to describe exactly WHERE and WHEN a liquidity gap would open up.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Think of TSECF/TSECCF as a maturity ladder: lay out every expected cash flow by date, then compute the running (cumulative) total. As long as the cumulative total stays positive at every future date, you're fine. The moment it would go negative at some date, you've found a real liquidity gap — the single most important number a treasurer watches.</p>
  <p>Repo and reverse repo are the one transaction type that moves TSAA (available assets) WITHOUT moving TSECF/TSECCF (cash flows) — because a repo is economically a secured LOAN, not a cash-flow-generating sale, even though a security's legal title changes hands. This is a frequently tested distinction since most other transactions hit all these measures together.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank enters a reverse repo, receiving a security as collateral for a short-term cash loan. Which term structure measures are affected, and which are NOT?", a: "TSAA (available assets) increases, since the bank now possesses the security. TSLGC (liquidity generation capacity) is also affected, since the bank could re-use that security. However, TSECF/TSECCF (actual cash flow term structures) are NOT affected by the repo transaction itself — a repo is economically a secured loan, not a cash-flow-generating sale, so it doesn't flow through the cash-flow ladder the way an outright purchase or sale would." },
    { q: "Why is a negative TSECCF at some future date considered a precursor to insolvency rather than just a manageable liquidity hiccup?", a: "TSECCF is the CUMULATIVE running total of all expected cash flows up to that date. If it goes negative, it means the bank's total expected cash inflows, even accumulated over the entire period, fall short of total expected outflows — a structural shortfall that (absent new funding sources not yet captured) would leave the bank unable to meet its obligations on that date, which is functionally an insolvency event unless remediated in advance." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The one that breaks the pattern", text: "Almost every transaction moves cash flows AND available assets together. Repo is the outlier: it moves possession of an asset (TSAA) while leaving the cash-flow ladder (TSECF/TSECCF) untouched — because it's a loan wearing a sale's clothing." },
    { title: "The most important negative number", text: "Everything in this reading's alphabet soup exists to answer one question: does the cumulative cash-flow line (TSECCF) ever dip below zero? That single crossing is Treasury's most-watched moment." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Cash flow taxonomy</strong>: deterministic/stochastic timing and amount (stochastic further split: credit, behavioral, indexed/contingent, new-business). <strong>Liquidity options</strong>: exercised per holder's own needs, dual balance-sheet + P&L effect. <strong>Three liquidity risk components</strong>: quantitative (less cash than expected) + funding cost (paying more than expected) = full economic liquidity risk. <strong>LGC</strong>: security-linked (BSL) vs security-unlinked capacity; TSLGC/TSCLGC track it over time. <strong>TSECF/TSECCF</strong>: the maturity ladder — negative TSECCF = insolvency precursor, THE key number. <strong>TSL0</strong>: can we cover a negative position? <strong>TSLaR</strong>: unexpected cash-flow variation (VaR-like). <strong>TSAA</strong>: possession-based available assets — repo/reverse repo moves TSAA/TSLGC but NOT TSECF/TSECCF, the reading's signature exception.</p>`
