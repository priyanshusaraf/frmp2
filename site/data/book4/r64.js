  title: "Liquidity and Leverage",
  tagline: "Formalizes the transactions-liquidity/funding-liquidity split from R63 and adds the piece that makes it dangerous: leverage.",

  teaches: `<p>Transactions vs funding liquidity risk, fractional-reserve banking and liquidity transformation, collateral markets (haircuts, rehypothecation, margin loans, repos, securities lending, TRS), the leverage ratio and leverage effect on ROE, economic balance sheets measuring implicit leverage, and transactions liquidity risk mechanics with the LVaR position-liquidation formula.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Leverage amplifies BOTH returns and liquidity fragility — the same multiplier that boosts ROE when ROA exceeds the cost of debt equally amplifies losses when it doesn't. The "economic balance sheet" tool reveals implicit leverage hidden inside short sales and derivatives that a simple balance sheet would miss entirely.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Maturity mismatch (funding long-term assets with short-term liabilities) is PROFITABLE in normal times — short-term lenders bear less risk and demand a lower rate — but it creates rollover (cliff) risk: refinancing might not be available, or only at escalating rates. The two liquidity risk types feed each other: tighter collateral terms (funding risk) can force an early, lossy unwind (transactions risk); being forced to sell illiquid assets first (to preserve liquid ones) can deepen realized losses, worsening funding risk further.</p>
  <p>The economic balance sheet reveals hidden leverage: a short sale shows leverage ratio 2.0 (higher than an equivalent margin-loan long position's 1.5) because the FULL value of the borrowed stock counts as an asset — leverage is INHERENT in a short, a CHOICE in a long. Options are represented at their delta-equivalent value, not full notional, since they're nonlinear with nonzero NPV.</p>`,

  misconceptions: [

    { wrong: "\"Gross leverage always gives the most accurate risk picture.\"", right: "If a short position is a HEDGE, gross leverage overstates true risk by ignoring the offsetting long position — net leverage (longs minus shorts, over capital) is more appropriate in that case." },
    { wrong: "\"A position being liquidated gradually over T days should use naive √T-scaled VaR.\"", right: "The naive √T scaling OVERSTATES risk for gradual liquidation — the corrected formula (using √[(1/T)Σi²]) gives a smaller, more accurate multiplier since exposure to each day's risk shrinks as the position is progressively sold down." },
    { wrong: "\"Off-balance-sheet vehicles like ABCP conduits and SIVs eliminated liquidity risk by removing it from the bank's balance sheet.\"", right: "They didn't eliminate risk, they MOVED it off-balance-sheet while still exposing the bank to it (often via implicit support or reputational commitments), directly feeding 2007-09 fragility when these vehicles needed rescuing." }

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank has ROA=6% and cost of debt=3%. Compare ROE at leverage ratios of 3 and 5.", a: "At L=3: ROE=3(6%)−2(3%)=12%. At L=5: ROE=5(6%)−4(3%)=18%. Leverage amplifies ROE as long as ROA>cost of debt — but the same formula would show ROE falling faster than ROA at higher leverage if ROA dropped below the cost of debt." },
    { q: "Why does a short sale show economic-balance-sheet leverage of 2.0 while an equivalent long position financed via a 50% margin loan shows only 1.5?", a: "In the short sale, the FULL value of the borrowed stock ($100) is sold and its proceeds held as restricted collateral, plus $50 margin is posted — the economic balance sheet shows $200 of assets over $100 of equity (leverage=2.0). In the long-margin case, only $150 of stock is purchased against $100 equity (leverage=1.5) — the short inherently requires borrowing the FULL stock value, while the long's leverage is a discretionary choice of how much to borrow." },
    { q: "A trader plans to liquidate a position evenly over 4 days rather than exit all at once. Should they use VaR(1-day)×√4 or the corrected formula, and why?", a: "The corrected formula (VaR(1-day)×√[(1/4)Σi²] ≈ ×1.3693) — naive √4 scaling (×2.0) assumes the FULL position is held intact and exposed to risk for all 4 days, while gradual liquidation means less and less of the position remains exposed as days pass, making the corrected, smaller multiplier more accurate." },
    { q: "A hedge fund is long $100M of stock and short $80M of a closely related stock as a hedge. Why might gross leverage overstate the fund's true risk compared to net leverage?", a: "Gross leverage would count both the $100M long and $80M short as separate exposures (total $180M over capital), ignoring that the short substantially OFFSETS the long's risk as a hedge. Net leverage ($100M−$80M=$20M over capital) better reflects the fund's true, much smaller net market exposure." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Transactions vs funding liquidity risk</strong> feed each other in a vicious loop. <strong>Maturity mismatch</strong> is profitable but creates rollover risk. <strong>Fractional-reserve banking</strong>: ALM works because deposits are sticky; off-balance-sheet vehicles (ABCP, SIVs) moved (not eliminated) risk pre-crisis; MMMFs can 'break the buck.' <strong>Leverage ratio</strong> L=assets/equity; r_E=L×r_A−(L−1)×r_D — amplifies gains AND losses. <strong>Economic balance sheets</strong>: short sale leverage (2.0) > margin-loan leverage (1.5) since shorts inherently borrow full value; gross leverage overstates risk for hedged shorts (use net); options represented at delta-equivalent value. <strong>Corrected T-day liquidation VaR</strong> < naive √T scaling for gradually-liquidated positions. Market liquidity: tightness, depth, resiliency.</p>`
