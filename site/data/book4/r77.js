  title: "Liquidity Transfer Pricing: A Guide to Better Practice",
  tagline: "Answers a deceptively simple question: how much should a business unit be charged (or credited) for the liquidity it uses (or provides)? Pre-crisis, many banks answered 'nothing.'",

  teaches: `<p>LTP process/governance best practices, pre-crisis deficiencies, four LTP approaches in ascending order of quality (ending at matched-maturity marginal cost), and contingent liquidity pricing for undrawn commitments.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This is the reading's signature "marginal, matched-maturity beats every flat/average shortcut" lesson, applied specifically to internal fund pricing. Getting this wrong (as many banks did pre-crisis) means systematically underpricing long-term illiquid assets — funding them on cheap overnight money while ignoring the real liquidity risk.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The four LTP approaches form a quality ladder: zero cost (liquidity treated as free — the worst approach) → pooled average cost (one flat spread for all maturities — undercharges long-tenor, overcharges short) → separate average cost (different flat spreads for assets vs. liabilities, but still maturity-blind) → matched-maturity marginal cost (spread varies BY MATURITY, based on the bank's actual current market cost of funds — the best practice).</p>
  <p>The worked example makes the stakes vivid: Bank MMM charges 1bp for a 1-year loan and 80bps for a 5-year loan (correctly pricing the much higher liquidity risk of longer-tenor lending), while Bank AVG charges a flat 2bps regardless of maturity — underpricing the 5-year loan by 4×. That mispricing is a systematic subsidy someone eventually exploits.</p>`,

    { name: "Worked example: matched-maturity vs average cost", math: "Bank MMM: 1bp(1yr)=$10, 80bps(5yr)=$80. Bank AVG: flat 2bps=$20 for BOTH.", note: "The 5-year loan is underpriced by 4× under the average approach." },
    { name: "WAL method (uncertain-cash-flow amortizing pools)", math: "Charge = matched-maturity rate at portfolio's WAL × portfolio balance", note: "$1B of 15yr loans, WAL=8yr, 8yr rate=58bps → charge=$5.8M." },
    { name: "Contingent commitment charge rate", math: "Rate = (prob. of drawdown × undrawn amount × cushion cost) / total credit line amount", note: "$20M line, $15M undrawn, 70% draw prob, 15bps cushion cost → rate=0.07875% → charge=$15,750." }

      name: "LTP process and governance best practices",
      def: "LTP should be centrally managed by a group treasury, using the marginal cost of funds matched to product maturity (historically LIBOR/swap curve; going forward, SOFR-based). Loans (assets) are charged a liquidity premium; deposits (liabilities) are credited for the liquidity they provide, based on maturity.",
      example: "Pre-crisis deficiencies: decentralized funding with weak controls, LMIS unable to compute granular costs, compensation schemes rewarding profits that ignored liquidity cost, underpricing via zero/average-cost approaches, no stress-test-based sizing of the liquidity cushion, illiquid long-term assets funded on cheap overnight money, flat average charges that ignored business-line-specific contingent risk.",

      name: "Four LTP approaches (ascending quality)",

Pooled average cost: one flat spread above/below swap curve for all maturities — undercharges long-tenor assets, overcharges short; distorts loan-to-deposit ratio if spread is adjusted. Separate average cost: different flat spread for assets vs. liabilities, still flat across maturities — same maturity-blindness, just for two curves instead of one. Matched-maturity marginal cost (best practice): spread varies by maturity, based on the bank's actual current market cost of funds — operationally harder to build/maintain, but prices risk correctly.",
      example: "Bank MMM charges 1bp/1yr and 80bps/5yr on $100,000 loans → $10 and $80. Bank AVG charges flat 2bps regardless of maturity → $20 for BOTH the 1-year and 5-year loan. The 5-year loan is underpriced by 4× under the average approach.",

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank uses pooled average cost LTP with a flat 3bps spread. Why does this systematically underprice a 7-year loan while overpricing a 3-month loan?", a: "Pooled average cost applies ONE flat spread regardless of maturity, essentially averaging the true (maturity-varying) liquidity cost across all tenors. Since longer-tenor assets carry genuinely higher liquidity risk (and thus should command a higher spread) while shorter-tenor assets carry lower risk (and should command a lower spread), the flat average necessarily UNDERcharges the long-tenor loan and OVERcharges the short-tenor one relative to their true, maturity-specific liquidity costs." },
    { q: "A $1B pool of 20-year amortizing loans is expected, via historical prepayment behavior, to actually repay over a weighted-average life of 6 years. The current 6-year matched-maturity rate is 45bps. Compute the LTP charge.", a: "Charge = 0.0045 × $1,000,000,000 = $4,500,000." },
    { q: "A $30M credit line has $10M drawn and $20M undrawn, with a 60% probability of the undrawn portion being drawn under stress, and a liquidity cushion cost of 20bps. Compute the contingent commitment charge.", a: "Rate = (0.60×$20M×0.0020)/$30M = $24,000/$30,000,000 = 0.08%. Charge = 0.0008×$30,000,000 = $24,000." },
    { q: "Why should the liquidity cushion held against contingent commitments be built from cash and government securities rather than funded with cheap overnight borrowing?", a: "The whole PURPOSE of the liquidity cushion is to be reliably available during a funding stress event. If the cushion itself were funded with overnight borrowing, that funding could evaporate in the very same stress scenario the cushion is meant to protect against — undermining its reliability exactly when needed. Cash and government securities are stable, unencumbered, and don't depend on continued market access to remain available." }

  summary: `<p><strong>LTP</strong> should be centrally managed, using marginal cost of funds matched to maturity. <strong>Four approaches</strong> (ascending quality): zero cost (liquidity=free) → pooled average cost (one flat spread) → separate average cost (two flat spreads) → <strong>matched-maturity marginal cost</strong> (best practice — spread varies by maturity, correctly above average for long tenor, below for short). Worked example: flat 2bps underprices a 5-year loan by 4× vs. the correct 80bps. <strong>Amortizing loans</strong>: tranche into bullet-equivalent pieces; <strong>WAL method</strong> for uncertain-cash-flow pools: charge=matched-maturity rate at WAL×balance. <strong>Contingent commitment charge</strong> = (draw probability×undrawn×cushion cost)/total line; the liquidity cushion itself must be cash/govt securities, not overnight funding.</p>`
