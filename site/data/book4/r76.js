  session: "Repos, Transfer Pricing & Rate Risk",
  title: "Repurchase Agreements and Financing",
  tagline: "Repos are the workhorse of short-term secured funding — built from the settlement formula up through their starring role in two 2008 collapses to the specials-trading mechanics that make Treasury auction dynamics tradeable.",

  teaches: `<p>Repo mechanics and settlement, borrower/lender motivations, counterparty vs. liquidity risk in repos, Lehman and Bear Stearns as 2008 case studies, general vs. special collateral, and the special spread/Treasury auction cycle.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Dense and calculation-heavy — budget real time here. Repos underpin an enormous share of short-term secured funding in the financial system, and their failure mechanics were central to both Bear Stearns' and Lehman's 2008 collapses.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>A repo is economically a secured loan dressed as a sale-with-buyback: you sell a security today and agree to buy it back later at a slightly higher price — that price difference IS the implied interest. Repo (borrower/seller's side) and reverse repo (lender/buyer's side) are the same trade viewed from opposite sides.</p>
  <p>General collateral (GC) trades get the highest repo rate because the lender doesn't care WHICH specific security they get — any bond in the broad category will do. Special collateral trades get a LOWER "special rate" because the lender specifically wants THAT bond (for shorting or financing purposes) and is willing to accept less interest in exchange for guaranteed access to it. The special spread (GC rate − special rate) narrows right after a Treasury auction (fresh supply) and widens before the next one (scarcity as shorts must roll into the still-scarce current issue).</p>`,

Lehman alleged JPM abused insider access to drain ~$14B in collateral while already overcollateralized. Bear Stearns: shifted from unsecured commercial paper to secured term repo pre-2007 (seemingly more stable) — but as lenders grew unwilling to roll term repos in the crisis, terms shortened, haircuts grew, and a March 2008 confidence-driven run led to mass non-rollover and collapse.",

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank borrows $25M via repo for 45 days at a 0.4% annualized rate. Compute the repurchase price.", a: "Repurchase price = $25,000,000 × [1 + 0.004×(45/360)] = $25,000,000 × 1.0005 = $25,012,500." },
    { q: "Why did Bear Stearns' shift from unsecured commercial paper to secured term repo pre-2007 fail to protect it from a funding crisis?", a: "The crisis wasn't about collateral quality — it was a confidence-driven run. As market confidence in Bear Stearns deteriorated, lenders became unwilling to ROLL (renew) term repos regardless of the collateral backing them, terms shortened, haircuts grew, and a March 2008 run led to mass non-rollover — demonstrating that 'secured' financing isn't immune to a funding run driven by counterparty confidence rather than collateral risk." },
    { q: "Why does the special spread on an on-the-run Treasury issue typically narrow immediately after a Treasury auction and widen again before the next one?", a: "Right after an auction, fresh supply of the newly-issued (OTR) security floods the market, making it easier to obtain and depressing the special repo rate further below GC (narrowing the spread). As the next auction approaches, that same issue becomes scarcer relative to demand from short-sellers needing to roll their positions into it, widening the special spread again — a predictable supply-driven cycle." },
    { q: "Distinguish the fed funds-GC spread from the special spread, and explain why a question describing 'the spread widening during stress' needs careful reading.", a: "The fed funds-GC spread measures the gap between the fed funds rate and the general collateral repo rate (driven by overall Treasury scarcity or market stress). The special spread measures GC rate minus a SPECIFIC bond's special rate (driven by demand for that particular security). Both can widen during stress for different reasons — a careful reader must identify which specific spread a question is describing, since they respond to different underlying drivers." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Secured doesn't mean run-proof", text: "Bear Stearns thought secured term repo was safer than unsecured CP. It wasn't — a run is about confidence, not collateral. The lesson repeats throughout this book: cash-timing mismatches don't care how 'safe' your financing structure looks on paper." },
    { title: "The auction cycle's breathing pattern", text: "Special spreads breathe with the auction calendar: exhale (narrow) right after fresh supply arrives, inhale (widen) as the next auction approaches and scarcity returns." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Repurchase price</strong> = contract price×[1+rate×(days/360)]. <strong>Repo</strong> (borrower side) / <strong>reverse repo</strong> (lender side). <strong>Counterparty risk</strong> (minor, collateral-mitigated) vs. <strong>liquidity risk</strong> (persistent concern — collateral value/liquidity during stress). <strong>Bear Stearns/Lehman</strong>: secured repo financing still ran under confidence-driven stress — secured ≠ run-proof. <strong>GC rate</strong> (highest, indifferent to specific bond) vs. <strong>special rate</strong> (lower, lender wants a specific bond). <strong>Special spread</strong> = GC−special rate; narrows post-auction, widens pre-auction; bounded [0%, GC rate], tighter post-2009 via failed-trade penalty. <strong>Financing value</strong> = $100×spread×(days/360). Fed funds-GC spread ≠ special spread — two different measures.</p>`
