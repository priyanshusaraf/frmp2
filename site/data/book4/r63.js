  session: "Liquidity Risk Management",
  title: "Liquidity Risk",
  tagline: "Opens the book with the two faces of liquidity risk everything else builds on: can I exit this position without moving the price against myself, and can I roll my financing before it comes due?",

  teaches: `<p>The LVaR formula machinery (normal and stressed cost of liquidation), six sources of funding liquidity, three unforgettable case studies (Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, Metallgesellschaft), Basel III liquidity ratios, and liquidity black holes.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Every other reading in Book 4 is an elaboration of the split introduced here: transactions (market) liquidity risk vs. funding liquidity risk. The three case studies teach the book's most important lesson — an economically sound position can still bankrupt you on a cash-timing mismatch.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Cost of liquidation in normal markets is just half the bid-ask spread times position value. In STRESSED markets, that spread itself widens and becomes uncertain — so stressed cost uses the spread's mean PLUS a confidence-multiple of its standard deviation, producing a cost that in the reading's own example comes out roughly 3.7× the normal-market figure. LVaR = ordinary VaR + this liquidation cost — a risk number that acknowledges you might not get to exit at the mid-price.</p>
  <p>The three case studies (Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, Metallgesellschaft) all teach the SAME lesson despite completely different mechanisms: the hedge or asset can be economically sound — even profitable on paper — and still bankrupt you on a cash-timing mismatch. Margin calls are due in cash, now, regardless of whether the underlying position is "right."</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why is stressed-market liquidation cost roughly 3.7× the normal-market cost in the reading's worked example, rather than just modestly higher?", a: "Stressed cost uses the spread's mean PLUS a confidence-multiple (γ×σ) of its standard deviation — under stress, spreads don't just have a higher average, they also become far more volatile/uncertain, and the confidence-adjustment term compounds this into a dramatically larger liquidation cost than simply scaling the normal-market mean spread." },
    { q: "Explain the shared lesson across Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, and Metallgesellschaft despite their very different underlying positions.", a: "In each case, the underlying economic position (mortgage book, gold hedge, oil hedge) may have been sound or even eventually profitable — but a cash-timing mismatch (a funding run, an unexpected price spike triggering margin calls, falling prices triggering margin calls) forced action or collapse before the position's fundamental soundness could matter. Margin calls and funding withdrawals are due in cash, immediately, regardless of the position's paper value." },
    { q: "Why might uniform liquidity regulation across banks, pension funds, and insurers actually increase systemic risk rather than reduce it?", a: "If all institution types are forced to hold the same liquid assets or react identically to the same market shock, they all become forced sellers (or buyers) of the same assets at the same time — removing the diversity of behavior that would otherwise cushion a shock, since different institution types with different rules would naturally act at different times and in different ways." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The 3.7x reveal", text: "Normal cost to liquidate: manageable. Same position, stressed market: 3.7× the pain — because spreads don't just widen, they become genuinely uncertain, and LVaR has to price both effects." },
    { title: "Right about the asset, dead anyway", text: "Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, Metallgesellschaft — three completely different businesses, one identical epitaph: 'the position was fine, the timing wasn't.'" },
    { title: "Sameness is the danger", text: "When every institution type follows the same rulebook, they all reach for the exit at the same moment — diversity of regulation is a shock absorber, not red tape." }

  summary: `<p><strong>LVaR</strong> = VaR + cost of liquidation; normal cost=Σ[α×s/2], stressed cost=Σ{α×[μ+γσ]/2} (≈3.7× normal in the worked example). <strong>Six funding-liquidity sources</strong>: cash/treasuries, deposits (surprisingly unstable), trading book liquidation, securitization, borrowing ability, central bank borrowing. <strong>Three case studies</strong> (Northern Rock, Ashanti Goldfields, Metallgesellschaft): economically sound positions bankrupted by cash-timing mismatches — the book's central recurring lesson. <strong>Basel III</strong>: LCR=HQLA/30-day outflow≥100%, NSFR=ASF/RSF≥100%. <strong>Liquidity black holes</strong>: positive feedback trading (stop-losses, delta-hedging, forced liquidation) destabilizes; uniform regulation across institution types can itself create black holes — regulatory diversity stabilizes.</p>`
