  title: "Covered Interest Parity Lost: Understanding the Cross-Currency Basis",
  tagline: "CIP is supposed to be an iron law — a textbook no-arbitrage condition. It's been persistently violated since 2008. This reading also covers the global USD funding gap that set the stage for that violation.",

  teaches: `<p>Covered interest parity's baseline condition, FX swaps vs. cross-currency basis swaps, the cross-currency basis and why it opened up, and — the macro backdrop — how banks funded USD asset growth, measuring the global USD funding gap, and the Fed's unprecedented central-bank swap network response.</p>`,

  why: `<p>CIP is a textbook risk-free arbitrage condition — its persistent violation since 2008 is a genuine puzzle the reading resolves via two causes (market liquidity decline, risk premia) and "limits to arbitrage." The global USD funding gap is the macro-scale version of exactly the funding-gap/rollover-risk concept from R64, scaled up to the entire global banking system.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Covered interest parity says two ways to "invest in USD" should have identical return: invest directly at the USD rate, or convert to a foreign currency, invest at the foreign rate, and lock in reconversion at the forward rate. A persistent gap between these two returns is, in principle, risk-free arbitrage — which is exactly what CIP violations represent.</p>
  <p>Since 2008, USD has traded at a persistent premium in FX swaps, and the cross-currency basis (b) captures the interest-rate adjustment needed to restore CIP given this "too-wide" forward premium. TWO causes explain the nonzero basis: (1) decline in market liquidity (wider bid-ask spreads eat the arbitrage profit), (2) risk premia (rising counterparty and sovereign credit risk). And THREE demand sources explain why the basis opened up post-crisis (banks hedging balance-sheet mismatches, institutional investors hedging FX portfolio risk, US firms issuing foreign-currency debt) — while "limits to arbitrage" (balance-sheet expansion brings credit/capital/funding/liquidity risk, and post-crisis regulatory pressure discourages this) explain why the gap hasn't closed despite being, in principle, free money.</p>
  <p>The USD funding gap scales this same tension to the entire global banking system: a funding gap exists whenever USD asset investment horizons exceed the maturity of the USD liabilities/swaps funding them. Domestic-currency mismatches are backstopped by the home central bank (lender of last resort in its own currency) — but no central bank outside the Fed can create USD, making foreign-currency funding gaps structurally more dangerous. The Fed's swap-line network made it, in effect, an international lender of last resort.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why is a persistently positive cross-currency basis considered a 'textbook risk-free arbitrage' that nonetheless hasn't been closed?", a: "In principle, an arbitrageur could borrow at the cheaper rate implied by the basis and lend at the more expensive rate, capturing the spread risk-free. In practice, executing this trade requires expanding the arbitrageur's balance sheet — bringing credit risk on both legs, capital/funding risk, and mark-to-market liquidity risk. Post-crisis regulatory, shareholder, and creditor pressure has made market participants manage their balance sheets far more conservatively, creating 'limits to arbitrage' that prevent the basis from closing despite its risk-free appearance." },
    { q: "Why couldn't European central banks simply act as lender of last resort to solve their own banks' USD funding gap during the 2008 crisis?", a: "No central bank outside the Federal Reserve can create U.S. dollars — European central banks could provide unlimited amounts of their OWN currency to their banks, but not USD. This structural asymmetry is precisely why the Fed's swap-line network was necessary: it let foreign central banks obtain USD from the Fed (collateralized by foreign currency) and then auction it to their own banks locally." },
    { q: "Why might a bank's home-country regulatory balance sheet understate its true USD funding vulnerability?", a: "Vulnerabilities are visible only at the CONSOLIDATED, GLOBAL balance sheet level. Many banks book the majority of their foreign-currency claims through foreign offices/subsidiaries rather than the home-country entity — as the Swiss example illustrates (~80% of total consolidated assets are foreign claims, ~80% of which are booked outside Switzerland itself), so looking only at the domestic balance sheet would miss the bulk of the actual USD exposure." }

  summary: `<p><strong>CIP</strong>: F=S(1+r)/(1+r*) — a violation is risk-free arbitrage in principle. <strong>FX swaps</strong> (short-term, forward-rate reconversion) vs. <strong>cross-currency basis swaps</strong> (long-term, original-spot reconversion, periodic basis payments). <strong>Cross-currency basis b</strong>: the rate adjustment restoring CIP (distinct from the forward premium F−S); positive since 2008 (USD borrower pays extra). <strong>Two causes</strong> of nonzero basis: liquidity decline, risk premia. <strong>Three demand sources</strong> (bank hedging, institutional hedging, US firms' FX debt issuance) explain why it opened; <strong>limits to arbitrage</strong> (balance-sheet expansion costs) explain why it hasn't closed. <strong>USD funding gap</strong>: exists whenever USD asset horizons exceed funding maturity; foreign-currency gaps are structurally more dangerous since no non-Fed central bank can create USD; visible only at the CONSOLIDATED GLOBAL level. <strong>Fed's swap network</strong>: unlimited, fully-collateralized lines to key central banks — zero Fed counterparty risk, effectively making the Fed an international lender of last resort.</p>`
