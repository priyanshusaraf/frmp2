  title: "Liquidity Stress Testing",
  tagline: "Builds the formal liquidity stress-testing framework: four funding-liquidity categories, one core sufficiency formula, and six design dimensions that determine whether a stress test is useful or just theater.",

  teaches: `<p>Four categories of funding liquidity, the stressed liquidity asset buffer formula, and six stress test design dimensions.</p>`,

  why: `<p>A stress test's usefulness depends entirely on its DESIGN — scope, scenario development, assumptions, outputs, governance, and integration with other models. Get any of these six wrong and the test becomes theater rather than genuine risk management.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Reverse stress tests flip the usual logic: instead of picking a scenario and forecasting its impact, you assume FAILURE first and work backward to find the critical drivers that would cause it — a useful supplement to forward-looking hypotheticals, since it can reveal vulnerabilities a forward-looking scenario might never think to test.</p>
  <p>"Garbage in, garbage out" is the reading's warning about assumptions: the whole stress test is only as good as its key assumptions (investment portfolio haircuts, deposit outflows, unsecured wholesale funding, collateral requirements, contingent liabilities, business reduction) — a technically sophisticated model built on unrealistic assumptions produces a false sense of security.</p>`,

Integration with other models: capital stress testing, ALM, and funds transfer pricing (FTP) should all be consistent with the liquidity stress test.",

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank holds $50M in liquid assets, but $20M of that is contractually earmarked for a specific planned capital expenditure. How should this $20M be categorized, and why does it matter for stress testing?", a: "It should be categorized as RESTRICTED liquidity — technically liquid, but with a predetermined, fixed operational use that makes it unavailable for general funding shortfalls. In a liquidity stress test, only the unrestricted $30M should be counted as genuinely available buffer capacity; including the restricted $20M would overstate the bank's true stress resilience." },
    { q: "Why is a reverse stress test a valuable complement to a standard forward-looking hypothetical scenario test?", a: "A forward-looking hypothetical scenario test starts from an assumed shock and forecasts its impact — it can only reveal vulnerabilities the scenario designer thought to test. A reverse stress test starts from an assumed FAILURE outcome and works backward to identify what combination of circumstances would cause it — this can surface critical vulnerabilities and failure paths that scenario designers might never have thought to construct forward, providing a genuinely different angle of insight." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Four funding liquidity categories</strong>: operational (day-to-day), contingent (stress-scenario buffer), strategic (opportunities), restricted (liquid but locked to fixed uses). <strong>Stressed buffer</strong> = normal buffer − stressed outflows + stressed inflows. <strong>Six design dimensions</strong>: scope (firm-wide to business-unit), scenario development (historical/hypothetical/reverse), assumptions ('garbage in, garbage out'), outputs, governance (ALCO, 3 lines), integration with other models (capital stress testing, ALM, FTP).</p>`
