  tagline: "Closes Session 11 with the non-deposit half of bank funding: what sources exist, how to size the funding gap, and the two ways to estimate the bank's overall cost of funds.",

  teaches: `<p>Nondeposit funding sources, the available funds gap formula, and two approaches to estimating overall funding cost (historical average vs. pooled funds).</p>`,

  why: `<p>When deposits alone can't cover a bank's funding needs, nondeposit sources fill the gap — but each source has a different cost, risk profile, and regulatory treatment. The available funds gap formula is how a treasurer quantifies exactly how much nondeposit funding is actually needed.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The two cost-estimation approaches look in opposite directions: HISTORICAL AVERAGE COST is backward-looking — what did all our existing funding actually cost us? POOLED FUNDS is forward-looking — what's the minimum return we need to earn on NEW loans/securities to cover the cost of all NEW funds? A bank pricing a new loan should care about the forward-looking pooled-funds number, not the backward-looking historical average, since past funding costs are sunk.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank is deciding what interest rate to charge on a new batch of commercial loans. Should it reference historical average funding cost or the pooled funds approach, and why?", a: "Pooled funds — this forward-looking approach calculates the minimum return the bank must earn on NEW loans/securities to cover the cost of all NEW funds being raised (deposits + nondeposit + equity). Historical average cost reflects the sunk cost of funding already raised, which is irrelevant to correctly pricing new, forward-looking lending decisions." },
    { q: "A bank projects $500M in loans/investments and expects $420M in available deposits and other funds. What is its available funds gap, and what does this imply?", a: "Available funds gap = $500M − $420M = $80M. This positive gap implies the bank needs to raise $80M through nondeposit funding sources (fed funds, repos, FHLB advances, CDs, etc.) to cover its projected loan/investment growth." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Nondeposit sources</strong>: fed funds, repos, discount window, FHLB advances, negotiable (jumbo) CDs (legally deposits, functionally money-market instruments), Eurocurrency deposits, commercial paper, long-term nondeposit debt. <strong>Available funds gap</strong> = projected loans/investments − projected deposits/available funds; choice among sources depends on cost, risk, maturity, regulation. <strong>Funding cost estimation</strong>: historical average cost (backward-looking, sunk) vs. pooled funds (forward-looking, minimum return needed on new business) — use pooled funds for new lending decisions.</p>`
