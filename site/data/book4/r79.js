  tagline: "Two complementary tools: IS (interest-sensitive) gap protects net interest income/margin; duration gap protects net worth (equity value). Know both formulas, both sign conventions, and both limitations cold.",

  teaches: `<p>NIM and the IS gap, change in NII from a rate change, duration-based price change, the leverage-adjusted duration gap, and the limitations of each tool.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This is a favorite reading for multi-part calculation questions. IS gap and duration gap answer genuinely DIFFERENT questions (income protection vs. net worth protection) and can point in seemingly opposite directions on the same balance sheet — both simultaneously correct.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>IS gap asks: if rates change, does my net interest INCOME change? Positive gap (more rate-sensitive assets than liabilities) = asset sensitive = NII rises when rates rise. Negative gap = liability sensitive = NII falls when rates rise.</p>
  <p>Duration gap asks a different question: if rates change, does my NET WORTH (equity value) change? To fully insulate net worth, a bank needs DA = (TL/TA)×DL — NOT simply DA=DL, because assets almost always exceed liabilities (positive equity), so equal percentage value changes on unequal dollar bases still move net worth. A typical bank (long-duration mortgages, short-duration deposits) has a NEGATIVE IS gap (liability sensitive) AND a POSITIVE duration gap (assets exposed more than liabilities) — these two gaps point in seemingly opposite directions, and BOTH are simultaneously correct, because they're answering different questions (income vs. net worth).</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank's 0-90 day IS gap is −$500M. If rates rise by 75bps, what is the approximate change in NII?", a: "ΔNII = 0.0075 × (−$500M) = −$3.75M — a liability-sensitive (negative gap) position loses NII when rates rise." },
    { q: "A bank has D_A=6, D_L=4, Total Liabilities=$900M, Total Assets=$1,000M. Compute the leverage-adjusted duration gap and interpret its sign.", a: "D_gap = 6 − (900/1000)×4 = 6−3.6 = 2.4 (positive). A positive duration gap means net worth FALLS as rates rise (assets lose more value than liabilities, given the leverage adjustment) — this is the typical bank profile (long-duration assets, shorter-duration liabilities)." },
    { q: "Explain how a bank can simultaneously have a negative IS gap and a positive duration gap, and why this isn't a contradiction.", a: "IS gap measures INCOME sensitivity (which repricing bucket has more liabilities than assets); duration gap measures NET WORTH sensitivity (present value impact of rate changes on the whole balance sheet). A typical bank funds long-duration, fixed-rate assets (mortgages) with short-duration liabilities (deposits) — this makes it liability-sensitive in the near term (negative IS gap, since liabilities reprice faster) while ALSO having a positive duration gap (since the long-duration assets' present value swings more than the short-duration liabilities' present value). These are two different lenses on the same balance sheet, and both are correct simultaneously — they don't need to match." },
    { q: "Why is duration gap analysis considered less reliable for large interest rate moves than for small ones?", a: "Duration is a linear (first-order) approximation of the relationship between value and yield — it ignores convexity, which becomes more significant as the rate change gets larger. For small rate moves, the linear approximation is close to accurate; for large moves, the true price-yield relationship curves away from the linear duration estimate, requiring a convexity adjustment for accuracy." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Two different insurance policies", text: "IS gap insures your INCOME statement. Duration gap insures your BALANCE SHEET (net worth). A bank can have great income-statement insurance and terrible balance-sheet insurance at the same time — they're not the same policy." },
    { title: "Matching durations isn't enough", text: "D_A=D_L feels like it should work — but with more assets than liabilities in dollar terms, matching the percentage-move rate (duration) still leaves a dollar-value mismatch. You have to adjust for leverage (TL/TA) to actually cancel out net worth exposure." }

  summary: `<p><strong>NIM</strong>=NII/earning assets. <strong>IS gap</strong>=IS assets−IS liabilities; positive=asset sensitive, negative=liability sensitive; <strong>ΔNII</strong>=Δrate×IS gap. <strong>Duration-based % price change</strong>≈−D×Δi. <strong>Leverage-adjusted duration gap</strong>: D_gap=D_A−(TL/TA)×D_L — full insulation needs D_A=(TL/TA)×D_L, NOT simply D_A=D_L. Duration gap sign: zero=insulated, positive (typical bank)=net worth falls with rising rates, negative=net worth rises. <strong>Limitations</strong>: IS gap assumes uniform rate moves and clean repricing timing; duration gap assumes small parallel shifts and struggles with demand-deposit/prepayment cash flows. A typical bank has NEGATIVE IS gap AND POSITIVE duration gap simultaneously — both correct, since they measure income vs. net worth respectively.</p>`
