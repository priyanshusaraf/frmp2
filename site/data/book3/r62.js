  title: "Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Reforms",
  tagline: "Closes the entire book with the actual formula behind 'the SA for operational risk': the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA) — a financial-statement proxy combined with the bank's own loss history.",

  teaches: `<p>The Business Indicator (BI) and its three components, BI buckets and the business indicator component (BIC), the internal loss multiplier (ILM), full capital requirement by bucket, why SMA replaced AMA, and operational loss data criteria.</p>`,

  why: `<p>The SMA is deliberately simpler and more comparable across banks than the AMA it replaced — a direct response to AMA's failure to converge on consistent best practices. This is the final destination of the LDA's frequency/severity philosophy (R43), now expressed as a non-model-based regulatory formula.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The SMA combines two ingredients: a FINANCIAL-STATEMENT PROXY for the bank's scale/activity (the Business Indicator — roughly, "how big and active is this bank"), and the bank's OWN LOSS HISTORY (the Internal Loss Multiplier — roughly, "has this bank actually lost more or less than a typical bank its size would"). A bank with average loss experience gets ILM=1 (capital = BIC, unchanged); worse-than-average history pushes ILM above 1 (capital rises); better-than-average pushes it below 1 (capital falls) — but only for banks large enough to reach Bucket 2 or 3. Small (Bucket 1) banks never apply the ILM at all — their capital is just BIC.</p>`,

  misconceptions: [

    { wrong: "\"General maintenance contracts on bank property and equipment count toward SMA gross operational losses.\"", right: "They're EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED — general PP&E maintenance costs are ordinary running costs, not operational risk losses, despite feeling 'operational' in a loose sense. This is a favorite exam distractor." },
    { wrong: "\"The BIC calculation applies the bank's top bucket rate to its entire Business Indicator.\"", right: "BIC is a MARGINAL, tax-bracket-style calculation — each portion of BI within a given bucket's range gets that bucket's rate, not the top rate applied to the whole BI." },
    { wrong: "\"The SMA was adopted because it offered more modeling flexibility than the AMA.\"", right: "The opposite — the SMA deliberately REDUCES flexibility (a single non-model-based formula) specifically because AMA's flexibility produced poor cross-bank comparability and no convergence on best practices." }

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank has BI = €50 billion. Set up (without fully computing) the marginal BIC calculation.", a: "BIC = (12% × €1bn) + (15% × €29bn, the portion from €1bn to €30bn) + (18% × €20bn, the portion above €30bn up to €50bn) — a tax-bracket-style marginal calculation, NOT 18% applied to the full €50bn." },
    { q: "A bank's average annual operational losses over the last 10 years are exactly in line with what its BIC would predict for a typical bank its size. What is its ILM, and what does this mean for its capital requirement?", a: "ILM = 1 (Loss Component = BIC in this case), meaning capital = BIC × 1 = BIC — the bank's own loss history exactly matches industry-average expectations, so its capital requirement is unchanged from the pure financial-statement-based BIC." },
    { q: "A bank has only 3 years of quality operational loss data due to a recent merger. How does this affect its SMA capital calculation?", a: "With less than 5 years of data, the ILM is SKIPPED ENTIRELY, and capital = BIC alone (as if the bank were in Bucket 1, regardless of actual bucket) — insufficient loss history data disqualifies the bank from having its own loss experience factored in." },
    { q: "Why does the SMA explicitly exclude general PP&E maintenance contract costs from gross operational loss, even though maintenance sounds like an operational matter?", a: "General maintenance is an ORDINARY, RECURRING RUNNING COST of doing business — not a loss resulting from a discrete operational risk EVENT (fraud, system failure, error, etc.). Including it would conflate normal business expenses with actual risk-driven losses, distorting the loss data used to calibrate capital requirements. This exclusion is specifically flagged as a common point of confusion." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Size plus track record", text: "SMA capital = how big and active you are (BI/BIC) × how well you've actually managed risk historically (ILM). A big bank with a spotless loss record pays less than an equally big bank with a messy one." },
    { title: "Tax brackets for banks", text: "BIC is computed exactly like income tax brackets — the first €1bn of BI is taxed at 12%, the next chunk at 15%, and so on. Never apply the top rate to the whole pie." },
    { title: "The exclusion that feels wrong but is right", text: "PP&E maintenance sounds operational — but the SMA draws a hard line: ordinary running costs aren't operational risk LOSSES. Memorize this exclusion precisely because it feels counter-intuitive." }
