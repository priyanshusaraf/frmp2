  book: 3, reading: 46,
  session: "Operational Risk Overview",
  title: "Integrated Risk Management",
  tagline: "Zooms out from operational risk specifically to enterprise risk management (ERM) generally, then zooms back in on stress testing as the connective tissue to Session 9's capital readings.",

  teaches: `<p>ERM's governance-culture-appetite triad (plus capital/stress testing for financial firms), RAROC and economic capital previewed, and the stress testing taxonomy.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This reading closes Study Session 7 by placing operational risk inside the bigger ERM picture, and previews RAROC (R56) and economic capital (R57) — the direct callback that Session 9 fully develops. Notice how operational risk's low correlation with market/credit risk offers meaningful diversification benefit in capital aggregation.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>ERM's triad — governance, culture, appetite — mirrors the three-lines structure at an enterprise level: governance sets WHO does what, culture sets HOW people behave when no one's watching, appetite sets WHERE the limits are. For financial firms specifically, a fourth pillar (risk capital and stress testing) exists because financial firms face regulatory capital requirements that non-financial firms don't.</p>
  <p>The stress-testing taxonomy has two dimensions worth separating: analytical approach (quantitative vs. qualitative) and risk type (measurable vs. immeasurable) — and three named approaches: parameter testing (shock model INPUTS), macroeconomic testing (shock SCENARIOS), and reverse testing (start from a FAILURE, work backward to what would cause it).</p>`,

Three approaches: parameter (model) testing (shock parameter values to test model robustness), macroeconomic testing (shock scenarios to test solvency/resilience), reverse testing (start from a failure outcome, work backward to the circumstances that would cause it).",
      example: "A comprehensive operational risk stress-testing framework has three modules: expected nonlegal loss forecast, legal loss, and idiosyncratic scenario add-on. Frequency/severity modeling uses regression against macro variables, or a (modified/conditional) LDA with Monte Carlo — a conditional LDA is a middle ground between full regression and plain LDA.",
      pitfall: "Severity is HARDER to model credibly than frequency — a subtle but tested asymmetry.",
      related: [{ r: 55, label: "R55 — full bank-wide stress testing" }],

  recall: [
    { q: "Why does aggregating economic capital across market, credit, and operational risk produce a total LESS than the simple sum of each risk type's standalone capital?", a: "Assuming imperfect correlation between risk types (they don't all materialize simultaneously and to the same degree), diversification benefit reduces the combined capital need below the naive sum. Operational risk in particular has historically shown LOW correlation with market and credit risk, contributing meaningful diversification benefit." },
    { q: "A risk team wants to understand what combination of circumstances would be needed to cause the bank's capital ratio to breach its regulatory minimum. Which stress-testing approach are they using?", a: "Reverse testing — starting from a defined failure outcome (breaching the capital minimum) and working backward to identify the circumstances/scenarios that would cause it, rather than starting from a scenario and forecasting forward." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Working backward from disaster", text: "Reverse testing is detective work in reverse: 'here's the crime scene (failure) — now what sequence of events could have led here?' Parameter and macro testing work forward instead; reverse testing works backward." }

  summary: `<p><strong>ERM triad</strong>: governance (roles across three lines + audit + Risk Committee), culture (behaviors/values), appetite (tolerance levels) — financial firms add a FOURTH pillar (capital/stress testing). <strong>RAROC</strong> (previewed, full mechanics in R56) = risk-adjusted net income/economic capital. <strong>Economic capital</strong> ≈ Pillar 1 + Pillar 2; aggregates at LESS than the simple sum across risk types — op risk's low correlation with market/credit risk is a genuine diversification benefit. <strong>Stress-testing taxonomy</strong>: quantitative/qualitative × measurable/immeasurable; three approaches — parameter (shock inputs), macroeconomic (shock scenarios), reverse (work backward from failure). Op-risk stress framework: nonlegal loss + legal loss + idiosyncratic scenario add-on; severity harder to model than frequency.</p>`
