  title: "High-Level Summary of Basel III Reforms",
  tagline: "A deliberately brief bridge reading — the December 2017 reforms (effective 2022) that finalize Basel III, setting up R62's detailed SMA formula. Know the goals and big-picture shifts, don't get lost in mechanics.",

  teaches: `<p>The four goals of the December 2017 reforms, what changed by risk type, and the output floor rule.</p>`,

  why: `<p>GARP explicitly says: don't get lost in the mechanics here. This reading's job is to explain WHY the 2017 reforms exist (restrict internal models, standardize more, add an output floor) before R62 gives you the actual operational risk formula that resulted.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The 2017 reforms have a consistent philosophy across every risk type: RESTRICT internal models (banks were using them to shrink capital in ways regulators found hard to compare across institutions) and EXPAND standardized approaches (more comparable, harder to game). The output floor is the enforcement mechanism: no matter how favorable a bank's internal model result looks, its RWA can't fall below 72.5% of what the standardized approach would require — a hard backstop against model-shopping.</p>`,

CVA risk: IRB approach removed entirely; must use standardized (SA-CVA) or basic (BA-CVA) approach.

Standardized building blocks used to compute the floor: SA for credit risk, SA-CCR for derivatives counterparty risk, SA-CVA/BA-CVA (or 100% of counterparty credit risk capital) for CVA, SEC-ERBA/SEC-SA/1,250% weight for securitization, and the plain SA for both market risk and operational risk.",

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank's internal model produces RWA of $80M for a portfolio, while the standardized approach would require $120M. What is the bank's actual required RWA under the output floor rule?", a: "Output floor = 72.5% × $120M = $87M. Since the bank's own model result ($80M) is below this floor, the bank must use $87M (max of $80M and $87M) as its required RWA." },
    { q: "Why does the 2017 reform package specifically restrict A-IRB for large and mid-sized corporates and financial institutions, rather than removing it for all credit exposures?", a: "These larger exposure categories showed the greatest cross-bank capital variation and were judged hardest to validate/compare reliably across institutions when banks used their own internal models — smaller or more standardized exposure categories didn't raise the same comparability concerns, so the restriction was targeted rather than universal." }
  ],

  hooks: [
    { title: "The 72.5% seatbelt", text: "No matter how good your internal model claims your risk is, the output floor is the seatbelt that stops you from claiming less than 72.5% of what the standardized approach says — model optimism has a hard limit." }
  ],

  summary: `<p><strong>Four goals</strong>: expand standardized approach robustness (credit, CVA, op risk), restrict internal models for the same three risk types, add G-SIB leverage buffer, create a risk-sensitive output floor. <strong>By risk type</strong>: standardized credit risk more granular (LTV-based mortgage weights); A-IRB removed for large/mid corporates & financial institutions (forced to F-IRB) with input floors added; CVA's IRB option removed entirely (SA-CVA/BA-CVA only); operational risk's AMA and all SAs replaced by the single SMA (R62). <strong>Output floor</strong>: RWA=max(approved approach, 72.5%×standardized) — IRB explicitly barred from the floor calculation for every risk type.</p>`
