  title: "Risk Capital Attribution and Risk-Adjusted Performance Measurement",
  tagline: "RAROC answers one question with real teeth: is this loan, project, or business unit actually worth the capital it ties up?",

  teaches: `<p>Risk capital vs. economic capital vs. regulatory capital, basic and detailed RAROC equations, the three judgment calls (time horizon, default probability, confidence level), hurdle rate and adjusted RAROC, diversification benefits (stand-alone/fully diversified/marginal capital), and RAROC best practices.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This reading builds RAROC from the ground up and closes with the genuinely hard part: diversification benefits are real, but allocating them fairly across business units is contested and political. It's the quant payoff of Book 3, directly reusing the EL/UL logic from Credit Risk Book 2.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>RAROC's core idea: don't just ask "did this loan make money?" — ask "did it make ENOUGH money to justify the capital it tied up?" A loan can generate positive revenue and still be a bad decision if the capital it consumes could earn more elsewhere. The DETAILED RAROC formula makes this precise: revenue minus costs minus expected losses minus taxes, plus a return on the economic capital itself, all divided by that economic capital.</p>
  <p>Diversification benefit is real (combined capital needs are less than the sum of standalone requirements) but allocating that benefit fairly is contested — three different capital concepts (stand-alone, fully diversified, marginal) serve three different purposes and none is simply "more correct" than the others.</p>`,

Confidence level: must match the firm's target credit rating (AA/AAA needs >99.95%).",

Lowering the confidence level cuts required capital MOST DRAMATICALLY for firms whose big losses are rare (op/credit/settlement risk-heavy books).",

  misconceptions: [
    { wrong: "\"A project with RAROC above the hurdle rate should always be accepted.\"", right: "The simple RAROC-vs-hurdle-rate rule ignores systematic risk exposure — a project can pass this test yet fail the ARAROC test (which nets out systematic risk via CAPM and compares to the risk-free rate), correctly identifying it as value-destroying once risk is properly priced in." },
    { wrong: "\"Marginal capital for each activity should sum to exactly the total combined capital.\"", right: "Marginal capital amounts NORMALLY sum to LESS than total combined capital — this is expected and correct, not an error, because marginal capital measures each activity's incremental contribution GIVEN the others already exist, and these increments overlap in how they capture shared diversification benefit." },
    { wrong: "\"A longer RAROC time horizon (e.g., a full business cycle) would give more reliable risk-adjusted performance measures.\"", right: "Risk and return data over periods longer than about one year quickly become unreliable — this is exactly why one year remains the standard default despite the conceptual appeal of capturing a full business cycle." },
    { wrong: "\"Diversification benefits assumed in economic capital models are stable and can be relied upon in a crisis.\"", right: "Correlations can COLLAPSE toward ±1 in a crisis, wiping out assumed diversification benefits exactly when the firm needs them most — a crucial caution for economic capital modeling." }

  recall: [
    { q: "A project shows RAROC of 12% against a hurdle rate of 9% (accept signal), but its beta is 1.5, risk-free rate is 5%, and market return is 11%. Should the firm proceed?", a: "Compute ARAROC = 12% − 1.5×(11%−5%) = 12%−9% = 3%. Since 3% < 5% (risk-free rate), REJECT the project — despite passing the simple RAROC-vs-hurdle-rate test, the project doesn't adequately compensate for its systematic risk exposure once properly adjusted via CAPM." },
    { q: "Why does marginal capital for two activities (A and B) sum to LESS than their combined fully-diversified capital, and why is this not an error?", a: "Marginal capital measures each activity's incremental capital contribution GIVEN the other already exists in the portfolio — both activities' marginal calculations 'take credit for' the shared diversification benefit from the other's presence, causing double-counting when summed. This is expected: marginal capital answers 'what does adding this ONE activity change,' not 'what's this activity's fair share of the total,' which is what fully diversified (pro-rata allocated) capital answers instead." },
    { q: "Why would a bank use point-in-time default probabilities for RAROC's expected loss calculation but through-the-cycle default probabilities for its economic capital sizing?", a: "Expected loss for pricing/short-term decisions needs to reflect CURRENT credit conditions accurately (PIT), since that's what's actually being priced into a specific transaction today. Economic capital, meant to be a stable strategic buffer against unexpected loss over time, benefits from the smoother, less volatile TTC default probability estimates, since ratings (and hence required capital) change less often under a TTC lens — avoiding needless capital churn from short-term credit fluctuations." },
    { q: "Why might correlations assumed in an economic capital model provide a false sense of security?", a: "Correlations often COLLAPSE toward ±1 during a genuine crisis — exactly when diversification benefit is needed most, it tends to evaporate, because previously uncorrelated risks start moving together under systemic stress. A model built on 'normal times' correlations can dramatically understate capital needs in exactly the tail scenario it's meant to protect against." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Two hurdles, not one", text: "RAROC clears the first hurdle (beats the WACC-based rate). ARAROC clears a second, sneakier hurdle (beats the risk-free rate, AFTER subtracting a systematic-risk toll). A project can clear the first and trip on the second." },
    { title: "Three capital concepts, three jobs", text: "Stand-alone capital pays the bonus. Fully diversified capital sets the solvency floor. Marginal capital guides 'should we grow this business line.' Same portfolio, three different numbers, three different questions." },
    { title: "Correlation's disappearing act", text: "Diversification benefit is a magic trick that vanishes exactly when you need it most — correlations rush toward 1 in a crisis, and the 'benefit' the model promised evaporates." }
  ],

  summary: `<p><strong>Economic capital</strong> = risk capital + strategic risk capital; allocate the GREATER of risk capital and regulatory capital per division. <strong>Detailed RAROC</strong> = [revenue−costs−EL−taxes+return on econ capital−transfers]/economic capital. Three judgment calls: <strong>time horizon</strong> (1yr default, longer horizons unreliable), <strong>default probability</strong> (PIT for pricing, TTC for capital/strategy), <strong>confidence level</strong> (tied to target credit rating). <strong>RAROC vs hurdle rate</strong> (after-tax CAPM WACC) ignores systematic risk level; <strong>ARAROC</strong> = RAROC−β(market return−rf), compared to rf, corrects this. <strong>Stand-alone</strong> (incentive pay) / <strong>fully diversified</strong> (solvency, pro-rata allocated) / <strong>marginal</strong> (portfolio decisions, sums to less than total — expected) capital serve different purposes. Correlations can collapse to ±1 in a crisis, erasing assumed diversification benefit.</p>`
