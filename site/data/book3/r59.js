  title: "Capital Regulation Before the Global Financial Crisis",
  tagline: "The origin story of modern bank capital regulation: Basel I (1988, credit risk only) and Basel II (2004/2007, three pillars, sophisticated credit approaches, and operational risk capital for the first time).",

  teaches: `<p>Basel I's three capital ratios and RWA, off-balance-sheet CEA, the 1995 netting amendment, the 1996 market risk capital amendment, Basel II's three pillars, Basel II's three credit risk approaches (with the full IRB formula), Basel II's three operational risk approaches, and Solvency II's insurance parallel.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This reading has more testable formulas than almost any other reading in this book — budget serious drilling time. Every later Basel reading (2.5, III, the 2017 finalization) is a patch on the framework built here.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Basel I's big innovation was RISK-WEIGHTING: instead of treating all assets equally for capital purposes, weight them by riskiness (0% for T-bills, 100% for corporate loans). Basel II's big innovation was SOPHISTICATION: instead of one crude risk-weight bucket per asset type, let banks use their own PD estimates (IRB) for a more risk-sensitive capital charge — and, for the first time, explicitly capitalize operational risk.</p>
  <p>The IRB formula is the Vasicek/Gordy one-factor Gaussian copula (identical machinery to R26's WCDR and R29's V(T,X)) applied as the actual regulatory capital rule: Capital = EAD×LGD×[WCDR−PD]×MA. Higher-rated corporate exposures see their capital requirement fall substantially under IRB relative to Basel I's flat treatment — the whole point of adding risk sensitivity.</p>`,
