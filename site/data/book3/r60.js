  title: "Solvency, Liquidity, and Other Regulation After the Global Financial Crisis",
  tagline: "The 2007-09 crisis exposed exactly where Basel II fell short — this reading is the point-by-point fix: Basel 2.5, Basel III, and the new liquidity regime that addresses the risk that actually killed banks in 2008: liquidity, not insolvency.",

  teaches: `<p>Basel 2.5's three fixes to market risk capital (stressed VaR, IRC, CR charge), Basel III's capital tiers/ratios/buffers, the liquidity ratios (leverage ratio, LCR, NSFR), contingent convertible bonds (CoCos), and the broader Dodd-Frank reform wave.</p>`,

  why: `<p>2008's real killer was liquidity, not insolvency — banks with adequate capital still failed because they couldn't fund themselves day to day. This reading is where regulation finally addresses that specific failure mode with the LCR and NSFR, a direct thematic link to Book 4's entire liquidity risk framework.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Basel 2.5 patches market risk capital with THREE additions: stressed VaR (calibrated to the worst year in the bank's own recent history, not a fixed 2008 assumption), the incremental risk charge (IRC, for credit-sensitive trading book instruments, using a constant-level-of-risk rebalancing assumption), and the comprehensive risk charge (replacing specific risk charge and IRC for correlation-sensitive instruments like ABS/CDOs, with unrated/deep-junk tranches requiring dollar-for-dollar capital).</p>
  <p>Basel III's capital buffers work like a car's safety margin: the capital conservation buffer (2.5% of RWA) is MANDATORY, built in good times, drawn down in stress — dividends get constrained as it's depleted. The countercyclical buffer (0-2.5%) is DISCRETIONARY, set by national regulators to dampen credit overheating. Don't conflate the two buffers' governance — one is a rule, the other is a dial regulators can turn.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank's HQLA is $45M and its net 30-day cash outflow under stress is $40M. Does it meet the LCR requirement?", a: "LCR = 45/40 = 112.5%, which exceeds the 100% minimum requirement — the bank meets the LCR standard." },
    { q: "Why is stressed VaR calibrated to each bank's own worst historical year rather than a fixed industry-wide stress period like 2008?", a: "Different banks have different portfolios and risk profiles, so a fixed universal stress period might not capture each bank's OWN worst-case exposure. Calibrating to each bank's own worst one-year period over its most recent seven years ensures the stress captures a genuinely severe scenario relevant to that specific bank's actual risk profile." },
    { q: "A bank's Tier 1 equity ratio falls to 6% during a downturn (below the 7.0% buffer-inclusive requirement but above the bare 4.5% minimum). What happens to its dividend policy?", a: "As the capital conservation buffer is drawn down, dividend payouts become increasingly constrained — at a 6% Tier 1 equity ratio specifically, the bank must retain at least 60% of its earnings (paying out no more than 40%), a mandatory constraint that tightens further as the ratio falls closer to the bare 4.5% minimum." },
    { q: "Explain why CoCo bonds are structured to convert to equity automatically rather than leaving conversion to bondholder discretion.", a: "The whole regulatory purpose of CoCos is to provide an automatic, reliable equity cushion exactly when a bank is under stress — leaving conversion to bondholder choice would undermine this, since bondholders facing a struggling bank would rationally choose NOT to convert (preferring their senior debt claim over new equity in a failing institution). Automatic triggering ensures the loss-absorption mechanism actually fires when needed, shifting losses to private CoCo investors instead of requiring a taxpayer bailout." }
