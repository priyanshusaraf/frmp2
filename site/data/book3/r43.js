  title: "Risk Measurement and Assessment",
  tagline: "The quant heart of Session 7 — where op risk gets numbers attached. Qualitative assessment, quantitative assessment (FTA, FAIR), the loss distribution approach, and the seven-step resilience process.",

  teaches: `<p>Operational loss data regulatory requirements, RCSAs/KRIs/KPIs/KCIs, fault tree analysis, the FAIR model and Swiss cheese model, the loss distribution approach (LDA), extreme value theory's limited fit for op risk, combining internal/external loss data, and the seven-step operational resilience process.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This is the reading where op risk transitions from qualitative frameworks to actual numbers — the LDA specifically underlies operational risk capital modeling, a direct ancestor of the SMA formula that closes the book (R62).</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The Loss Distribution Approach splits losses into two independently-modeled pieces: FREQUENCY (how often do losses happen — discrete, usually Poisson) and SEVERITY (how bad is each one — continuous, fat-tailed, usually lognormal). Model each separately, then convolute them (often via Monte Carlo) into an aggregate loss distribution. The 99.9th percentile of THAT aggregate distribution becomes the capital requirement.</p>
  <p>Fault tree analysis multiplies INDEPENDENT control failure probabilities together (AND conditions) — but real controls are rarely fully independent (they're often designed together), so naive multiplication can dramatically UNDERSTATE true joint failure probability. The Swiss cheese model captures this better: each control layer has holes, and bad outcomes happen only when holes in MULTIPLE layers momentarily align — the defense is keeping failure rates uncorrelated across layers.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank's fault tree analysis multiplies five independent control-failure probabilities to estimate a 0.0001485% chance of a successful phishing attack. Why might this significantly understate the true risk?", a: "The analysis assumes all five controls (firewall, employee vigilance, detection systems, etc.) fail independently. In reality, controls are often designed together and share common vulnerabilities or blind spots (e.g., the same IT team designs both the firewall and detection system) — true joint failure probability, accounting for this correlation, is likely higher than the naive multiplication suggests." },
    { q: "Under the loss distribution approach, why are frequency and severity modeled separately before being combined?", a: "Frequency (how often losses occur) and severity (how large each loss is) are driven by different underlying processes and have different statistical shapes — frequency is discrete and typically well-modeled by a single-parameter Poisson distribution, while severity is continuous and fat-tailed, typically lognormal. Modeling them separately, then convoluting (e.g., via Monte Carlo), captures the true aggregate loss distribution more accurately than trying to fit one distribution to the combined data." },
    { q: "A rogue employee's fraud causes a credit loss when a mismarked position leads to an uncollectible receivable. Is this loss captured in operational risk capital, credit risk capital, both, or neither?", a: "This is a boundary event tied to CREDIT risk — it's treated as credit risk (already captured in credit RWA) and is NOT double-counted in operational risk capital, even though the root cause (mismarking) is operational in nature." },
    { q: "Why does the reading caution that extreme value theory (EVT) is less useful for operational risk than for market risk?", a: "EVT's theoretical justification works best when there's ONE dominant underlying cause generating extreme losses (e.g., market crashes driven by a shared volatility regime). Operational risk losses come from genuinely heterogeneous causes (fraud, system failure, natural disaster, human error) with no single unifying generative process, undermining EVT's core assumption and limiting its practical fit." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Loss data</strong>: ≥10yr, €20,000 threshold, 4 dates (occurrence→discovery→reporting→accounting); boundary events tied to credit stay credit, tied to market stay operational. <strong>RCSA</strong> (inherent vs residual risk, qualitative, annual) tends to UNDERESTIMATE likelihood, OVERESTIMATE severity when backtested. <strong>KRI</strong> (exposure) / <strong>KPI</strong> (performance) / <strong>KCI</strong> (control effectiveness). <strong>Fault tree analysis</strong>: multiplies independent probabilities — unrealistic since real controls correlate; <strong>Swiss cheese model</strong> captures this better. <strong>FAIR model</strong>: factors → measure → Monte Carlo combine. <strong>LDA</strong>: frequency (Poisson) × severity (lognormal), convoluted, 99.9th percentile = capital; UoM homogeneity trades off data volume; copulas capture cross-UoM tail dependence. <strong>EVT</strong> poorly fits op risk's heterogeneous causes. <strong>Combining loss data</strong>: scaling, cut-off mix, filtering. <strong>Resilience</strong> (7 steps: IBS → tolerances → mapping → scenarios → remediate → communicate → annual self-assessment) is narrower than BCM.</p>`
