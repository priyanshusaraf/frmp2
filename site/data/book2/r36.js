  title: "Future Value and Exposure",
  tagline: "Builds the exposure vocabulary that R37's CVA formula plugs directly into — treat this as 'R37's input data.'",

  teaches: `<p>The full exposure metric family (expected MtM, EE, PFE, EPE, ENE, effective EE/EPE), how credit exposure differs from VaR, exposure profile shapes by product type, the netting factor formula, and margin period of risk (MPoR) mechanics.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Get the SHAPE of exposure profiles for different product types memorized — it's tested visually and verbally, not just numerically. Everything quantitative in R31-35 (netting, collateral parameters, CCP margin) becomes numerical input here.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The core distinction: EXPECTED EXPOSURE (EE) is the average of the potential-loss part of the value distribution (only counting scenarios where you're owed money) — a central-tendency measure. POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE (PFE) is a high-confidence WORST CASE at one specific point in time — a tail measure, like VaR but for exposure rather than loss.</p>
  <p>Exposure profile SHAPES differ by product because of different underlying forces: bonds/loans stay flat at notional; interest rate swaps HUMP (rising rate uncertainty vs. shrinking remaining cash flows fighting each other); FX/cross-currency swaps rise MONOTONICALLY (large final notional exchange dominates); long options rise until exercise (time value + moneyness potential); long-protection CDS rises then JUMPS at a credit event (spread widening, then the default payoff itself).</p>`,

  misconceptions: [
    { wrong: "\"Expected exposure (EE) can be negative, just like expected MtM.\"", right: "EE only counts the POSITIVE part of the value distribution (loss if MtM>0 AND counterparty defaults) — it's non-negative by construction, unlike expected MtM which can be negative." },
    { wrong: "\"Receiving payments less frequently than paying them reduces counterparty exposure.\"", right: "The opposite — RECEIVING more often than paying REDUCES exposure, since cash comes in faster than it's owed out, shrinking the average outstanding exposure window." },
    { wrong: "\"PFE analysis fully accounts for wrong-way risk since it already models worst-case exposure.\"", right: "PFE analysis explicitly IGNORES wrong-way risk, collateral-value uncertainty, and liquidity/liquidation risk — it silently assumes a strongly collateralized position. These specific omissions are the tested limitations, not a vague 'it's just an estimate.'" },
    { wrong: "\"Zero correlation (ρ=0) gives the maximum netting benefit.\"", right: "Perfect NEGATIVE correlation (ρ→−1) gives the maximum benefit (trades fully offset) — the netting factor formula shows benefit keeps improving as ρ falls below zero, not just to zero." }

  recall: [
    { q: "Why does an interest rate swap's exposure profile peak in the middle of its life rather than rising monotonically like an FX swap's?", a: "Two forces fight: rising uncertainty about future rate paths pushes exposure up over time (diffusion), while the shrinking number of remaining cash flows as maturity approaches pulls exposure down (amortization/roll-off). Early on diffusion dominates; later, roll-off dominates, producing a hump. An FX swap lacks this offsetting roll-off force as strongly, since its terminal notional exchange dominates and grows with time." },
    { q: "A netting agreement covers 4 trades with pairwise correlation 0. What is the netting factor, and what does it mean?", a: "Netting factor = √[(1+(4−1)×0)/4] = √(1/4) = 50%. This means netted exposure is roughly half of what gross (unnetted) exposure would be — reflecting substantial diversification benefit from combining 4 uncorrelated exposures." },
    { q: "List the specific risks that PFE analysis is known to silently ignore.", a: "Wrong-way risk, collateral-value uncertainty, and liquidity/liquidation risk. PFE analysis assumes a strongly collateralized position and doesn't model these — these specific omissions are the standard tested answer when asked about PFE's limitations." },
    { q: "Why does a swaption have HIGHER exposure than an equivalent forward swap before the exercise date, but LOWER exposure after?", a: "Before exercise, the swaption holder retains the OPTION to walk away if the swap would be unfavorable — this optionality itself has positive value in bad states, adding exposure relative to a forward swap that's locked in regardless. After the exercise date (once exercised into a swap, or lapsed), the swaption's distinguishing optionality is gone; the forward swap, having been obligated all along, can accumulate more downside exposure in adverse scenarios that the (now-decided) swaption already avoided by not exercising." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Exposure family</strong>: Expected MtM (can be negative) → EE (positive part only) → PFE (tail, high-confidence worst case) → EPE (time-average of EE) → ENE (counterparty's mirror) → effective EE/EPE (non-decreasing, captures rollover risk). Exposure vs VaR: used for pricing AND risk management, spans many future dates, must model netting/collateral. <strong>Profile shapes</strong>: bonds flat, swaps hump, FX/options rising, CDS rise-then-jump. <strong>Netting factor</strong> = √[(1+(n−1)ρ)/n] — ρ=1 no benefit, ρ→−1 maximum benefit. <strong>MPoR</strong>: 5-step process (call→collateral→settlement→grace→liquidation); PFE(MPoR)=z·vol·√(MPoR/250). PFE ignores wrong-way risk, collateral-value uncertainty, liquidity risk. Collateral is path-dependent.</p>`
