  title: "Portfolio Credit Risk",
  tagline: "Where the single-factor model gets built from scratch — the same model underlying Vasicek (R26), CDO copula pricing (R30), and the Gaussian copula (R29).",

  teaches: `<p>Default correlation for a two-firm portfolio, Credit VaR at the correlation extremes (ρ=1, ρ=0 with varying granularity), the single-factor model (conditional independence), and Credit VaR by simulation (the copula method).</p>`,

  why: `<p>The intuition to hold onto throughout: default correlation doesn't change a portfolio's EXPECTED loss, but it massively changes the SHAPE of the loss distribution — specifically the fat tail that Credit VaR is trying to measure. This single-factor model, unchanged, is exactly what R28 uses for tranche behavior and R30 uses to price synthetic CDO tranches.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Build intuition at the correlation extremes first. At ρ=1, a portfolio of many credits behaves like ONE credit — either everything defaults or nothing does, so Credit VaR is essentially binary (either $0 at low confidence, or nearly total loss at high confidence). At ρ=0, the law of large numbers takes over: with many independent credits, realized losses cluster tightly around expected loss (binomial), and MORE credits at the same total exposure (finer granularity) shrinks Credit VaR further, because idiosyncratic bad luck in one credit gets diluted across many others.</p>
  <p>The single-factor model formalizes this: each firm's asset return a_i = β_i·m + √(1−β_i²)·ε_i, defaulting if a_i ≤ k_i. The magic is CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE — once the common market factor m is realized, defaults across firms become independent (all the correlation lives in shared exposure to m). This is why simulating just ONE common factor, then treating each firm independently conditional on it, correctly reproduces the full correlated default structure.</p>`,

    { wrong: "\"Conditioning on the common market factor m increases uncertainty about individual defaults.\"", right: "It DECREASES it — conditional on m, each firm's default distribution has SD √(1−β²), strictly less than the unconditional SD of 1, because the systematic component of uncertainty has been resolved by observing m." }

  recall: [
    { q: "A $2,000,000 portfolio has PD=2%, RR=0%, and perfect correlation (ρ=1) across all names. What is the 95% Credit VaR?", a: "At ρ=1 the portfolio behaves as one credit: 98% chance of $0 loss, 2% chance of total $2,000,000 loss. EL=$40,000. At 95% confidence, the loss quantile is $0 (default probability 2% < 5% tail), so Credit VaR = 0−40,000, interpreted as $0 Credit VaR (loss doesn't exceed EL at that confidence level)." },
    { q: "Why does increasing the number of (equally-sized) credits in a zero-correlation portfolio reduce Credit VaR, and why does this effect weaken at very low PD?", a: "With independent defaults, the law of large numbers pulls realized portfolio loss toward its expected value as n grows — idiosyncratic bad luck in any one credit gets diluted across many others. At very low PD, though, defaults are so rare that even a large n doesn't fully smooth out the possibility of a small but nonzero cluster of defaults relative to the tiny expected loss, so the granularity benefit is muted." },
    { q: "In the single-factor model, why does conditioning on the market factor m make defaults independent across firms?", a: "By construction, all correlation between firms' asset returns is channeled through their shared exposure to the common factor m (via β_i). The idiosyncratic term ε_i is independent across firms by assumption. Once m is fixed (known), the only remaining source of variation in each firm's asset return is its own independent ε_i — so defaults become conditionally independent." },
    { q: "A highly granular portfolio (1,000 small, equal-sized loans) has default correlation ρ=0.4. Does its Credit VaR resemble the ρ=0, n=1,000 case from the reading?", a: "No — granularity only reduces IDIOSYNCRATIC risk. With ρ=0.4 (substantial systematic risk), the loss distribution retains a fat tail driven by the common factor, regardless of how many independent-seeming small loans make up the pool. Credit VaR would be much closer to a high-correlation scenario than the near-riskless ρ=0 granular case." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "One credit in disguise", text: "At ρ=1, a thousand loans are secretly one loan wearing a thousand costumes — they all default together or not at all." },
    { title: "The dial that granularity can't turn", text: "Granularity is a volume knob for idiosyncratic noise — turn it down by adding more loans. But it's not connected to the SYSTEMATIC risk dial at all; that one only turns with correlation." },
    { title: "The shared weather", text: "Think of m as the shared weather everyone's asset return partially depends on. Once you know the weather (m), each firm's remaining fate (ε_i) is its own private business, independent of everyone else's." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Default correlation</strong> (two-firm): ρ₁₂=(π₁₂−π₁π₂)/√[π₁(1−π₁)π₂(1−π₂)] — explodes combinatorially for n firms. <strong>Correlation extremes</strong>: ρ=1 → portfolio acts like ONE credit (binary VaR); ρ=0 + large n → binomial, granularity shrinks VaR via the law of large numbers (weaker at very low PD). <strong>Single-factor model</strong>: a_i=β_im+√(1−β_i²)εᵢ, default if a_i≤k_i — conditional independence given m is the key property, conditional SD=√(1−β²)<1. <strong>Credit VaR by simulation</strong>: define copula → simulate default times → portfolio P&L → aggregate to loss distribution. Granularity reduces IDIOSYNCRATIC risk only — systematic (correlation) risk survives no matter how many loans you add.</p>`
