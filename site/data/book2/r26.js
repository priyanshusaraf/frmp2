  session: "Credit Risk Estimation",
  title: "Credit Value at Risk",
  tagline: "The market-risk-VaR question ('how bad can losses get at confidence X?') for credit losses — with genuinely different mechanics: 1-year horizon, lumpy rare losses, heavier modeling machinery.",

  teaches: `<p>Market VaR vs Credit VaR contrasts; rating transition matrix multi-period math; a survey of the four main modeling families that fight it out across the rest of the book: Vasicek's Gaussian copula (also the Basel IRB engine), CreditRisk+, CreditMetrics, and the correlation model.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Credit losses are lumpy (defaults are discrete, rare events) and slow (1-year horizon, not 1-day) — so the smooth, high-frequency historical simulation approach from market risk (Book 1) doesn't work here. This reading surveys the specialized machinery built specifically for credit's different statistical texture.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Market VaR asks "what did daily P&L actually do over the last 1,000 days?" — plenty of data, smooth distribution. Credit VaR asks "what could a whole YEAR of defaults look like?" — defaults are rare, so you can't just look at history; you need a MODEL of how correlated defaults arise. The four families differ in what they capture: Vasicek/CreditRisk+ capture DEFAULTS ONLY; CreditMetrics captures BOTH defaults and downgrades (via Monte Carlo over a full rating transition matrix).</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A risk manager wants a model that captures losses from BOTH downgrades and outright defaults. Which of the three named models should they use, and why?", a: "CreditMetrics — it uniquely simulates the full rating transition (not just default/no-default) via Monte Carlo, marking to market using the credit-spread term structure appropriate to whatever new rating each simulated path lands on. Vasicek and CreditRisk+ only model the binary default/no-default outcome." },
    { q: "Why does a buy-and-hold credit strategy produce higher Credit VaR than a constant-level-of-risk strategy?", a: "Buy-and-hold rides out downgrades and absorbs the full mark-to-market or default loss from deteriorating credits. Constant-level-of-risk continuously sells downgraded names and replaces them with fresh, same-rated bonds, effectively refreshing the portfolio's risk profile and avoiding the full accumulated loss from any single name's deterioration." },
    { q: "What key real-world phenomenon does the rating-transition-matrix-to-the-Nth-power approach fail to capture, and why does it matter?", a: "Rating momentum — the empirical fact that a recent downgrade raises the probability of a further downgrade. The matrix-power approach assumes each period's transition is independent of prior transitions, understating the true risk of a credit that's already begun deteriorating." }

  hooks: [

  summary: `<p><strong>Market VaR</strong> (1-day, historical sim) vs <strong>Credit VaR</strong> (1-year, elaborate models — lumpy, rare losses). <strong>Migration matrices</strong>: raise to the Nth power for multi-year, fractional root for sub-year — assumes independence, violated by rating momentum. <strong>Vasicek's Gaussian copula</strong> (=Basel IRB engine): WCDR(T,X)=N[(N⁻¹(PD)+√ρ·N⁻¹(X))/√(1−ρ)] — no tail correlation captured (constant ρ). <strong>CreditRisk+</strong>: Poisson/negative-binomial, defaults only, needs least data. <strong>CreditMetrics</strong>: Monte Carlo over rating transitions, captures BOTH defaults AND downgrades — the answer whenever migration risk matters. <strong>Rebalancing</strong>: constant-level-of-risk < buy-and-hold in Credit VaR.</p>`
