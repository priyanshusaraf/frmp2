  session: "Credit Risk Estimation",
  title: "Structured Credit Risk",
  tagline: "R27's single-factor machinery applied to tranched products. The single most-tested idea: a 2×2 grid of how PD and correlation separately move each tranche's value and tail risk — in OPPOSITE directions for correlation.",

  teaches: `<p>Capital structure of a securitization, waterfall mechanics, key participants and their conflicts, the core comparative-statics grid (PD vs. correlation, senior vs. mezzanine vs. equity), default '01 and convexity, and implied correlation (compound vs. base).</p>`,

  why: `<p>Tranching redistributes a pool's total loss across investors of different seniority — and correlation reshapes WHO absorbs how much of that loss, without changing the pool's total expected loss much at all. This reading is where the 2008 crisis's mechanics become mathematically precise: rising correlation was bad for senior tranches and GOOD for equity — the opposite of naive "correlation=risk=bad for everyone" intuition.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Why does correlation help the equity tranche? Low correlation → defaults cluster tightly near their expected value (predictable, so equity is reliably wiped out a LITTLE). High correlation → outcomes polarize toward "almost no defaults" or "mass defaults" — and the "almost no defaults" scenarios are pure upside for the first-loss piece, since equity only cares about avoiding losses, not about the average. Senior tranches see the mirror image: they're fine in low-correlation, predictable scenarios, but rising correlation introduces polarized "mass default" scenarios that can actually breach their attachment point — something senior tranches almost never worried about under low correlation.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Default correlation in a securitized pool rises from 0.1 to 0.4, with PD unchanged. What happens to the senior tranche's value and VaR, and what happens to the equity tranche's value?", a: "Senior tranche value FALLS and its VaR RISES — higher correlation polarizes outcomes toward 'mass defaults,' introducing previously-rare scenarios where losses actually breach the senior attachment point. Equity tranche value RISES — higher correlation also increases the probability of 'almost no defaults' scenarios, which are pure upside for the first-loss piece that only cares about avoiding losses, not about the average outcome." },
    { q: "Explain intuitively why the mezzanine tranche's response to rising correlation is described as 'mixed.'", a: "Mezzanine sits between equity and senior in the loss-absorption order. At low default rates it behaves like senior (relatively insulated, only hurt in genuinely bad scenarios). At high default rates it behaves like equity (already absorbing losses, benefiting from any chance of a milder outcome). Its correlation sensitivity flips character depending on which regime the current default rate sits in." },
    { q: "A trader observes that compound correlation is high for the junior tranche, dips for mezzanine, and rises again for senior (a 'smile'). What does this pattern reveal, and what would we see if the one-factor Gaussian model were perfectly correct?", a: "It reveals that the one-factor Gaussian copula model is imperfect — the market is pricing tranches in a way inconsistent with a single, uniform correlation assumption. If the model were perfectly correct, implied correlation would be FLAT across all tranches, since one true ρ would fit every tranche's market price simultaneously." },
    { q: "In the waterfall example, why does a 4% default rate result in equity receiving its FULL residual cash flow while a 0% default rate results in $2M diverting away from equity?", a: "At 0% default, the pool generates a large residual cash flow ($17M) that exceeds equity's $15M OC trigger cap, so the excess ($2M) diverts to the trust rather than flowing to equity. At 4% default, the reduced pool cash flow leaves a residual ($13.8M) below the $15M cap, so no diversion occurs and equity keeps the entire (smaller) residual." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The 2×2 grid that matters most", text: "PD up: everyone loses (same direction). Correlation up: senior loses, equity WINS (opposite directions). If you remember one grid from this whole reading, remember this asymmetry." },
    { title: "Polarization helps the gambler at the bottom", text: "High correlation polarizes outcomes into 'almost nothing happens' or 'everything happens.' The equity tranche, which only fears losses (not variance), loves the 'almost nothing' scenarios that high correlation creates more of." },
    { title: "Smile = confession of imperfection", text: "Just like BSM's volatility smile (R15) confesses the model's flat-vol assumption is wrong, the correlation smile confesses the one-factor Gaussian copula's constant-ρ assumption is wrong. Same shape, same lesson, different market." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Capital structure</strong>: senior (safest) → mezzanine → equity/first-loss (riskiest). <strong>Waterfall</strong>: cash flows senior-first; OC trigger can divert cash from equity once residual falls below a cap. <strong>Comparative statics</strong>: ↑PD hurts ALL tranches; ↑correlation hurts SENIOR but HELPS EQUITY (mezzanine mixed) — the single most tested fact here, because polarized outcomes create more 'almost no defaults' upside for the first-loss piece. <strong>Convexity</strong>: equity positive, senior negative, mezzanine mixed. <strong>Implied correlation</strong>: compound shows a smile, base shows a skew — either pattern proves the one-factor Gaussian model is imperfect (a perfect model implies flat implied correlation). <strong>Participants</strong>: originator, underwriter, rating agencies (issuer-pays conflict), servicer (foreclosure-delay conflict), trustee (least conflicted).</p>`
