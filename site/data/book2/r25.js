  session: "Credit Risk Estimation",
  title: "Estimating Default Probabilities",
  tagline: "Arguably the single most important reading in Book 2 — the toolbox every later quant reading draws from.",

  teaches: `<p>Altman's Z-score, rating migration matrices (cumulative/marginal PD), hazard rates, CDS mechanics and spreads, the CDS-bond basis, real-world vs. risk-neutral PDs, and the precise numerical Merton model. Budget real time here.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Every downstream quant reading — Credit VaR (R26), portfolio credit risk (R27), structured credit (R28), CVA (R29, R37), credit derivatives (R30) — needs a default probability as an input. This reading is where you learn every method of actually producing one, and crucially, when to use which.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>There are fundamentally three ways to estimate PD: from a firm's financial STATEMENTS (Altman's Z-score — a discriminant function on balance-sheet ratios), from historical RATING BEHAVIOR (migration matrices — cumulative/marginal PD read off transition tables), or from MARKET PRICES (hazard rates backed out of credit spreads, or the Merton model backed out of equity value and volatility). Each answers a slightly different question and lives in a different part of the curriculum.</p>
  <p>The single most important conceptual fact: RISK-NEUTRAL PD (backed out of market spreads) is systematically HIGHER than REAL-WORLD PD (based on historical default rates) for the same firm — because market prices embed a risk premium for bearing systematic, illiquidity, and unsystematic risk that isn't captured by pure historical frequency. Use risk-neutral PDs for valuation/pricing; use real-world PDs for scenario analysis.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A 5-year CDS trades at 90bps with RR=65%. Estimate the average hazard rate.", a: "λ ≈ s/(1−RR) = 0.90%/(1−0.65) = 0.90%/0.35 ≈ 2.57% — the approximate constant hazard rate consistent with this credit spread and recovery assumption." },
    { q: "Why is risk-neutral PD systematically higher than real-world PD for the same firm?", a: "Risk-neutral PD assumes assets grow at the risk-free rate; real-world PD assumes assets grow at risk-free PLUS a risk premium, giving a higher expected asset value path and hence a LOWER probability of falling below the default threshold. The gap between the two compensates for systematic risk, illiquidity, and unsystematic risk that can't be fully diversified away." },
    { q: "Why might a CDS-bond basis be persistently positive rather than zero?", a: "The cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) option embedded in physically-settled CDS gives the protection buyer a valuable choice among deliverable bonds, and broad restructuring clauses add extra triggering scenarios — both push CDS spreads up relative to the bond yield spread, creating a positive basis." },
    { q: "Explain why investment-grade bonds show RISING marginal default probability in early years while junk bonds show FALLING marginal probability after the early years.", a: "IG issuers start from a position of apparent strength; the passage of time reveals which ones are actually deteriorating, so marginal PD creeps up as hidden problems surface. Junk issuers start already risky; the ones that survive the dangerous early period are self-selected as the sturdier survivors, so their marginal PD tends to fall thereafter." }
