  session: "Credit Risk Analysis",
  title: "Capital Structure in Banks",
  tagline: "The first genuinely computational reading in the book: if I know a loan's PD and loss rate, what's my average loss (EL), and how much worse could it plausibly get (UL)?",

  teaches: `<p>EL for a single asset and a portfolio; UL for a single asset and a portfolio (where diversification shows up via correlation cross-terms); risk contribution (each asset's slice of portfolio UL); and economic capital as a multiple of portfolio UL. Nearly every later Credit VaR reading (26, 27, 29) is a more sophisticated version of the same question asked here first.</p>`,

  why: `<p>The punchline: portfolio UL is much smaller than the sum of individual ULs — diversification is doing real work — and the leftover gap between "worst case" and "expected case" is exactly what economic capital exists to cover. This is the foundational computational reading; EL = PD×LGD×EAD is the single most-repeated formula in the entire book.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>EL is what you'd lose ON AVERAGE if you ran this loan book a thousand times — it's a cost of doing business, priced into spreads and reserves. UL is how much WORSE a particular bad year could be than that average — the thing capital exists to absorb. When you pool many loans together, their ULs don't simply add up (unless correlation is 1) — some of the bad luck in one loan gets cancelled out by good luck in another, which is exactly why portfolio UL < sum of individual ULs whenever correlation is imperfect.</p>
  <p>Credit losses are modeled with a BETA distribution (bounded 0-100%, flexible skew), not normal — because credit losses are inherently skewed: capped upside (get paid back in full) and a fat left tail (default).</p>`,

  misconceptions: [
    { wrong: "\"Portfolio UL equals the sum of individual asset ULs.\"", right: "Only true if every pairwise correlation is exactly 1. In every realistic case (ρ<1), portfolio UL is LESS than the sum — the cross-terms in UL_P² = ΣΣρ_ij UL_i UL_j capture real diversification benefit." },
    { wrong: "\"A PD decrease and a recovery-rate increase might offset each other on EL.\"", right: "They point the SAME direction — both LOWER EL (lower PD directly reduces EL; higher recovery rate lowers LR, which also reduces EL). A question combining both is testing whether you correctly sign both effects the same way, not whether they cancel." },
    { wrong: "\"Credit losses are well-approximated by a normal distribution, like market returns.\"", right: "Credit losses are modeled with a BETA distribution — bounded 0-100%, capped upside, fat left tail. Normal distributions don't capture this inherent skew." }

  recall: [
    { q: "A $5M loan has PD=2%, LR=50%, σPD and σLR given. If recovery rate rises from 40% to 55%, what happens to EL, and why doesn't this offset a simultaneous PD increase?", a: "LR = 1−RR falls from 60% to 45%, which lowers EL (since EL=EA×PD×LR). A simultaneous PD increase raises EL. These are independent, separately-signed effects on the same EL formula — they don't automatically cancel; you must compute (or at least sign) each change separately and combine them." },
    { q: "Explain, without formulas, why a 100-asset credit portfolio's UL is dramatically smaller than 100 times a single asset's UL.", a: "Portfolio UL depends on correlated cross-terms, not a simple sum. With realistic (well below 1) pairwise default correlation, bad outcomes in some loans are statistically offset by good outcomes in others — the portfolio's aggregate loss variability shrinks far below what summing each loan's individual UL would suggest. This diversification benefit is exactly what economic capital models are built to quantify." },
    { q: "Why does economic capital use a beta distribution instead of a normal distribution for credit losses?", a: "Credit losses are inherently skewed: there's a hard cap on the upside (full repayment, loss=0) but a fat left tail (default can wipe out most or all of the exposure). A beta distribution, bounded on [0,1] with flexible skew, captures this shape; a normal distribution would misprice both the cap and the tail." },
    { q: "What does RC₁ (risk contribution of asset 1 in a two-asset portfolio) actually measure, and why must RC₁+RC₂ = UL_P?", a: "RC₁ measures how much of the TOTAL portfolio UL is attributable to asset 1, accounting for its own risk and its correlation with asset 2. By construction the formula RC₁=(UL₁²+ρ₁₂UL₁UL₂)/UL_P decomposes the portfolio UL exactly, so the two risk contributions must sum to the total — no risk is created or destroyed by the decomposition, only reattributed." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The two-loss story", text: "EL is the bill you expect and budget for. UL is how much worse the bill could get in a bad year. Capital is savings set aside specifically for that second, scarier number." },
    { title: "Cross-terms are where diversification lives", text: "Portfolio UL isn't a sum, it's a sum PLUS cross-terms weighted by correlation. Kill the correlation, and the cross-terms — where all the double-counted risk was hiding — shrink toward zero." },
    { title: "Capped upside, fat left tail", text: "Credit losses look like a ski slope: a flat plateau at zero (get paid back) that suddenly drops off a cliff (default). Beta distribution, not the symmetric bell curve of market returns." }

  summary: `<p><strong>EL</strong> = EA×PD×LR (average loss). <strong>UL</strong> = EA√[PD·σLR²+LR²·σPD²] (variability around EL), σPD²=PD(1−PD). <strong>Portfolio EL</strong> just sums; <strong>portfolio UL</strong> involves correlation cross-terms (UL_P²=ΣΣρ_ijUL_iUL_j) — diversification benefit is real whenever ρ<1, vanishes only at ρ=1. <strong>Risk contribution</strong> decomposes UL_P back to the asset level (RC₁+RC₂=UL_P). <strong>Economic capital</strong> = CM×UL_P, the gap between expected and extreme-confidence (typically 99.97%) loss — modeled via a BETA distribution (capped upside, fat left tail) since credit losses are inherently skewed, not normal.</p>`
