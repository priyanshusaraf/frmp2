  title: "Credit Derivatives",
  tagline: "Puts a precise price on the CDS spread you've been treating as a given input since R25. Everything else here is a variation on one balance equation: PV(payments) = PV(payoff).",

  teaches: `<p>The CDS spread balance equation, risk-neutral PD implied by market spreads, marking CDS to market, binary CDS, credit indices, fixed coupons/up-front payments, CDS forwards and options, total return swaps, and synthetic CDOs.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Every prior reading (R25 onward) treated the CDS spread as a given number. This reading shows where that number actually comes from — solved by setting the PV of what the protection buyer pays equal to the PV of what they might receive, and solving for the breakeven spread.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>A CDS is a bet with a very specific balance sheet: the buyer pays a stream of premiums (PV of expected payments + accrual) in exchange for a contingent payoff if the reference entity defaults (PV of expected payoff). The market spread is whatever number makes these two sides EQUAL in present value. Once you have that spread, you can back out the RISK-NEUTRAL PD implied by the market — not the "true" PD, just whatever hazard rate reconciles the model spread with the quoted market spread.</p>
  <p>A useful shortcut: the recovery rate assumption barely matters for matching a given spread, because risk-neutral PD ≈ proportional to 1/(1−RR) — a higher assumed RR just implies a correspondingly higher RN PD, netting out in the final spread.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why does a binary CDS always trade at a higher spread than an economically identical vanilla CDS on the same reference entity?", a: "A binary CDS pays the FULL notional on default with no recovery offset, while a vanilla CDS payoff is reduced by the recovery rate (payoff = (1−RR)×notional). Since the binary payoff is larger for the same default probability, the balance equation (PV payments = PV payoff) requires a higher premium (spread) to compensate for the bigger promised payout." },
    { q: "A synthetic CDO's equity tranche earns 10%/year while its senior tranche earns only 0.5%/year on the same underlying pool. Is this evidence of mispricing?", a: "No — tranches are deliberately priced to reflect their very different expected losses. The equity tranche absorbs losses first and has a far higher expected loss per dollar of notional, so it must earn a correspondingly higher spread to be a fair investment. Different tranche spreads reflect seniority-consistent risk compensation, not an arbitrage opportunity." },
    { q: "A CDS trades with a fixed coupon of 100bps, but the current market spread is 150bps. Who pays the up-front payment, and why?", a: "The market spread (150bps) exceeds the fixed coupon (100bps), meaning the fixed-coupon contract is UNDER-compensating the protection seller relative to fair value — so the protection BUYER pays the SELLER an up-front amount equal to PV of the spread-coupon gap, to make the seller whole for accepting a below-market fixed coupon." },
    { q: "Why does the choice of recovery rate assumption have surprisingly little effect on the risk-neutral PD backed out from a quoted market CDS spread?", a: "Risk-neutral PD is approximately proportional to 1/(1−RR) in the spread-implied hazard rate relationship. A higher assumed RR mechanically implies a correspondingly higher implied PD to still match the same observed market spread — the two assumptions move together, largely netting out their combined effect on the final calibrated spread." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "One balance equation, many costumes", text: "PV(payments) = PV(payoff) is the whole reading's DNA. Binary CDS, up-front payments, synthetic CDOs — all just this same equation solved with different payoff assumptions." },
    { title: "No recovery cushion, bigger bill", text: "Binary CDS = the insurer promises to pay the FULL amount, no recovery discount. Naturally the premium (spread) has to be bigger to match that bigger promise." }

  summary: `<p>Core equation: <strong>PV(expected payments) = PV(expected payoff)</strong>, solved for spread s. <strong>Risk-neutral PD</strong> from market spreads is calibrated, not 'true'; RR assumption barely matters (RN PD ∝ 1/(1−RR)). <strong>MtM</strong>: spread widening since inception benefits the BUYER, hurts the SELLER. <strong>Binary CDS</strong> spread always exceeds vanilla (no recovery offset on payoff). <strong>Credit indices</strong>: 125 names, defaults shrink the pool and the ongoing payment. <strong>Up-front payments</strong> reconcile fixed coupon vs. market spread gaps. <strong>Forwards</strong> (no premium) vs. <strong>options</strong> (always a premium). <strong>TRS</strong> hedges credit AND rate risk, unlike pure CDS. <strong>Synthetic CDO</strong>: s(A+B)=C; different tranche spreads reflect seniority-consistent risk, not mispricing. <strong>Implied correlation</strong>: compound (smile) vs. base (skew) — either pattern reveals one-factor Gaussian model imperfection.</p>`
