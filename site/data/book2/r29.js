  title: "Credit Risk (in Derivatives)",
  tagline: "A bridge reading: recaps R25's default-probability toolkit, introduces CVA/DVA for the first time, and the Gaussian copula in its one-factor time-to-default form.",

  teaches: `<p>Hazard rate recap (unconditional vs. conditional PD), ISDA Master Agreement default mechanics, CVA/DVA first appearance, credit risk mitigants (netting), reduced-form vs. structural default correlation models, and the one-factor Gaussian copula for time-to-default.</p>`,

  why: `<p>If R37's CVA reading feels overwhelming later, it's because R29 rushes through the same ideas first — come back to this reading's CVA section as a running start. This reading also makes explicit the practical guidance on which PD (risk-neutral vs real-world) to use where.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>CVA answers "how much should I discount a derivative's value because my counterparty might not pay?" DVA is the mirror image — a BENEFIT to my own book value reflecting the (grim) fact that if I default, I don't have to pay either. Wrong-way risk (PD positively correlated with exposure — bad) and right-way risk (negatively correlated — good) determine whether this counterparty-risk adjustment gets worse or better as the trade itself moves in your favor.</p>`,

  formulas: [
    { name: "Value including default risk", math: "f = f<sub>nd</sub> − CVA + DVA", note: "f_nd = no-default value. CVA lowers value (cost); DVA raises it (benefit, since your own default relieves you of paying)." },
    { name: "Single uncollateralized derivative shortcut", math: "f = f<sub>nd</sub> × e^(−(credit spread)×T)", note: "No simulation needed if DVA=0 — just discount by the counterparty's credit spread." },

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank enters a new derivative trade that is positively correlated with its existing book of exposures to the same counterparty. What happens to CVA and DVA?", a: "Both CVA and DVA RISE. Positive correlation with the existing book increases the bank's exposure to the counterparty in the states where the counterparty is more likely to default (raising CVA) and increases the counterparty's exposure to the bank in states where the bank is more likely to default (raising DVA) — both risk measures move the same direction under this correlation." },
    { q: "Why can structural (Merton-style) default correlation models achieve much higher correlation than reduced-form models?", a: "Structural models tie default directly to a shared, continuously-evolving asset value process, so two firms' asset values (and hence default timing) can be made to move together very tightly by construction. Reduced-form models treat default as a Poisson-style jump driven by a hazard rate; synchronizing two independent jump processes into the same narrow time window is intrinsically harder, capping achievable correlation lower." },
    { q: "Exposures to a single counterparty across four trades are +5, −7, +10, −2 (millions). Compute gross and netted exposure, and explain the netting benefit.", a: "Gross exposure (sum of only positive-value trades) = 5+10 = $15M. Netted exposure (sum of ALL trades) = 5−7+10−2 = $6M. Netting captures the fact that in default, all obligations to and from the counterparty settle as one net amount — the negative-value trades offset the positive ones, cutting exposure by $9M here." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Hazard rate recap</strong>: conditional PD = unconditional PD(t)/survival(t−1). <strong>CVA</strong> = PV(cost if counterparty defaults); <strong>DVA</strong> = PV(benefit if the bank itself defaults); f=f_nd−CVA+DVA. <strong>Wrong-way risk</strong> (PD & exposure positively correlated) raises CVA, lowers DVA; right-way risk is the mirror. <strong>Netting</strong>: sum ALL trades (+ and −), not just positive-value ones. <strong>Reduced-form</strong> (fast, low achievable correlation, captures economic cycle) vs. <strong>structural</strong> (slow, arbitrarily high correlation, less direct cycle capture). <strong>One-factor Gaussian copula</strong> V(T,X)=N[(N⁻¹(Q(T))+√ρN⁻¹(X))/√(1−ρ)] — structurally identical to R26's Vasicek WCDR formula.</p>`
