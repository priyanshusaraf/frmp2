  title: "CVA",
  tagline: "The capstone quant reading of Session 6: multiplies R36's exposure profiles by R25's default probabilities into a single price for counterparty risk.",

  teaches: `<p>The base CVA formula, CVA as a running spread, how credit spread/recovery assumptions move CVA, netting and collateral inside CVA, MPoR scaling, incremental vs. marginal CVA, bilateral CVA (BCVA), and wrong-way/right-way risk with modeling approaches.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Structurally, everything in this reading is a variation on one formula — CVA = −Σ(exposure × default probability × loss rate, discounted). Understanding this as EL's derivatives-specific cousin (rather than a new concept) makes the whole reading tractable.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>CVA is EL = PD×LGD×EAD, generalized to a TIME SERIES of exposures instead of one fixed EAD. Each future date has its own expected exposure EE(t) and default probability q(t); CVA sums the discounted products across all dates. Everything else — netting's reduction of exposure, collateral's reduction of EE, MPoR scaling — is a variation on how exactly EE(t) and q(t) get computed before you plug them into this one sum.</p>
  <p>The trickiest asymmetry: incremental CVA answers "what does adding THIS new trade change CVA by" (pricing decision); marginal CVA answers "how much of the TOTAL netted CVA is attributable to each existing trade" (ex-post attribution). Same underlying machinery, different question, frequently confused.</p>`,

CVA with netting is never higher than CVA without netting (netting can't increase exposure).

  recall: [
    { q: "A bank is deciding whether to add a new derivative trade with an existing counterparty. Should it look at the trade's standalone CVA or its incremental CVA, and why?", a: "Incremental CVA — the change in the counterparty's TOTAL netted CVA from adding this trade. Standalone CVA ignores netting with the existing book; the actual pricing decision depends on how this trade's exposure interacts with (offsets or compounds) existing exposures under the netting agreement." },
    { q: "Why can BCVA be positive even though standalone (unilateral) CVA can only ever be negative?", a: "BCVA = CVA(counterparty) + DVA(institution). DVA is a benefit (positive contribution) reflecting the institution's own default risk. If the institution's own credit risk (DVA) exceeds the counterparty's credit risk (CVA) — i.e., the institution is riskier than its counterparty — BCVA can flip positive, something impossible for unilateral CVA, which only ever prices the counterparty's risk as a cost." },
    { q: "Explain why higher credit quality can actually make wrong-way risk WORSE, not better.", a: "A high-quality counterparty defaulting is a rare, surprising event — and when it does happen, it's more likely tied to an extreme, correlated, catastrophic scenario (since ordinary conditions wouldn't have caused it). This makes the JOINT bad outcome (high exposure + default) more severe when it occurs, even though it occurs less often — amplifying WWR's impact conditional on the tail event." },
    { q: "A gradual currency depreciation vs. a sudden currency devaluation both increase counterparty exposure. Why does collateral help in one case but not the other?", a: "Collateral calls and settlement take time (the margin period of risk). A GRADUAL exposure increase allows time to call for and receive additional collateral before the exposure grows too large. A SUDDEN jump (devaluation) outpaces the collateral call/settlement cycle — by the time collateral could be collected, the damage (or default) has already occurred." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Base CVA</strong> = −(1−RR)ΣEE(tᵢ)qᵢDF(tᵢ) — EL's derivatives cousin, stretched across time. <strong>Spread/recovery</strong>: ↑spread→↑CVA nonlinearly (capped at PD=100%); ↑RR→↑implied PD but ↓CVA. <strong>Netting/collateral</strong>: both reduce CVA (netting via exposure, collateral via EE); threshold/MTA raise CVA, initial margin lowers it. <strong>Incremental CVA</strong> (pricing a new trade) ≠ <strong>marginal CVA</strong> (attributing existing CVA) — a frequently confused pair. <strong>BCVA</strong> = CVA+DVA: can be positive (if institution riskier), symmetric across parties, netting can be a DISADVANTAGE if own DVA dominates. <strong>WWR</strong> (exposure & PD positively correlated: ↑CVA ↓DVA) vs <strong>RWR</strong> (mirror) — higher credit quality AMPLIFIES WWR impact, counterintuitively. Gradual exposure increases let collateral help; sudden jumps outpace it.</p>`
