  session: "Credit Risk Analysis",
  title: "Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling and Assessment",
  tagline: "Three jobs in one reading: CAMEL (bank health-check), the IRB regulatory capital formula, and the three families of default-prediction models — with Merton as the star.",

  teaches: `<p>CAMEL mnemonic for bank health; the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and IRB capital charge formula; three families of default models (judgmental, empirical, financial/market); the Merton model conceptually (equity as a call option on firm assets) and its cousins (Moody's-KMV, CreditMetrics, CreditRisk+); and RAROC.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Merton is the single most important model in the whole book — it comes back in R25 (precise numerical form) and R29 (inside CVA). Get comfortable with the CONCEPT here (equity = call option on assets) so R25's algebra feels like a continuation, not new material.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Merton's insight: shareholders effectively hold a call option on the firm's assets, struck at the face value of debt L. If assets exceed L at maturity, shareholders "exercise" by repaying debt and keeping the residual; if assets fall short, they walk away and creditors get the (insufficient) assets. This single idea — equity as a call option — is why option-pricing machinery (Black-Scholes) can price corporate default risk.</p>
  <p>The IRB capital formula has two exam-favorite comparative statics: asset correlation R DECREASES as PD increases (higher-PD firms are more idiosyncratic, less tied to the broad economy), and R INCREASES with firm size (bigger firms move more with the broad economy). Maturity adjustment β is higher for LOW-PD borrowers (more room to deteriorate) — capital requirements rise with maturity.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why does asset correlation R fall as a borrower's PD rises, in the IRB formula?", a: "Higher-PD firms tend to be more idiosyncratic — their fortunes are driven more by firm-specific troubles than by broad economic movements, so their asset value correlation with the general market (and hence with other firms) is lower." },
    { q: "State precisely how Merton's default point differs from Moody's-KMV's default point.", a: "Merton's default point uses only short-term debt. Moody's-KMV adds half of long-term debt to the default point — a separate fact from KMV's other distinguishing feature (using an empirical/historical, not standard normal, default distribution)." },
    { q: "A bank's loan generates RAROC of 12%, and its cost of capital is 14%. Is the loan a good business decision?", a: "No — despite a positive RAROC, 12% is below the bank's 14% cost of capital, meaning the loan destroys economic value relative to what the bank's capital could otherwise earn. Profitability requires RAROC to exceed the cost of capital, not just be positive." },
    { q: "Why is CreditRisk+ described as needing the least data among the three Merton-cousin models?", a: "It ignores capital structure entirely and models only a binary default/no-default event via a Poisson process — it doesn't need equity volatility, asset values, or rating transition matrices, just default rate and its variability, making it the most data-parsimonious of the three." }

  summary: `<p><strong>CAMEL</strong>: Capital, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity. <strong>CAR</strong> = Capital/RWA (min 8% Basel II, 10.5% Basel III). <strong>IRB charge K</strong>: R falls as PD rises, rises with size; β (maturity adj.) higher for low-PD borrowers. <strong>Three default model families</strong>: judgmental (5C), empirical, financial (Merton structural / reduced-form). <strong>Merton</strong>: equity = call option on assets struck at debt L; E=A·N(d1)−L·e⁻ʳᵀ·N(d2); PD_RN=N(−d2); DD=d2. <strong>KMV</strong> adds ½ long-term debt to the default point + uses historical distribution. <strong>CreditMetrics</strong>: mark-to-market via rating transitions. <strong>CreditRisk+</strong>: Poisson default-only, least data needed. <strong>RAROC</strong> = loan revenue/capital at risk; profitable only if RAROC > bank's cost of capital.</p>`
