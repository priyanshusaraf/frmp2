  title: "An Introduction to Securitization",
  tagline: "Closes the book by returning to securitization mechanics from R28, but from the plumbing side — participants, SPV structures, and the full set of named performance ratios.",

  teaches: `<p>Participants and the true sale, cash waterfall/first-loss piece/overcollateralization, three SPV structure types, why financial institutions securitize, credit enhancements, and the performance-ratio calculation zoo (delinquency ratio, default ratio, MPR, DSCR, WAC, WAM, WAL, CPR, PSA).</p>`,

  why: `<p>These ratios show up as plug-and-chug calculation questions, so make sure you can compute each one, not just define it. This reading also resolves a subtle but frequently-tested asymmetry: the SPV's liability side (notes issued) costs LESS than its asset side (receivables) — that gap is the excess spread everyone in the structure depends on.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The "true sale" concept is the legal foundation everything else depends on: the SPV must be a legally distinct entity, genuinely insulated from the originator's own insolvency — otherwise investors in the securitization would be exposed to the originator's OWN credit risk, defeating the entire purpose of tranching by asset performance instead.</p>
  <p>Overcollateralization is a subtle mechanism: pool assets EXCEED the notes issued against them (e.g., 101 mortgages backing 100 mortgages' worth of notes) — investors absorb one default "for free" before any tranche actually takes a loss. This is why the MOST SENIOR class is NOT the overcollateralized one — overcollateralization protects the senior tranche precisely by making the MOST JUNIOR class absorb the excess collateral risk.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A credit card ABS pool has total balance $57.8M, with $0.88M currently 90+ days past due and $1.1M written off. Compute the delinquency ratio and default ratio.", a: "Delinquency ratio = 880,000/57,800,000 = 1.522%. Default ratio = 1,100,000/57,800,000 = 1.903%. Both use total pool balance as the denominator but different numerators (currently-delinquent vs. already-written-off balances)." },
    { q: "A mortgage pool shows SMM = 2%. What is the annualized CPR?", a: "CPR = 1−(1−0.02)¹² = 1−0.7847 ≈ 21.53%." },
    { q: "Why is it wrong to say the most senior tranche in a securitization is 'the overcollateralized one'?", a: "Overcollateralization means the pool of assets exceeds the notes issued — that EXCESS sits at the bottom of the capital structure, absorbed by the MOST JUNIOR tranche. The senior tranche is protected BY this junior-absorbed excess, not itself 'overcollateralized' in the sense of holding the extra buffer." },
    { q: "Why does the SPV's cost of liabilities (notes issued) need to be lower than its cost of assets (receivables) for the structure to work?", a: "The gap between the higher-yielding assets (receivables, e.g., mortgage or credit card interest) and the lower-cost notes issued to investors IS the excess spread — the cash flow that pays servicing fees, credit enhancement costs, and ultimately flows to the equity/first-loss piece. Without this positive spread, there would be no residual value to distribute down the waterfall." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The junior tranche's gift", text: "Overcollateralization is a gift the junior tranche gives the senior tranche: 'here's one extra mortgage's worth of cushion, so you (senior) never feel the first default.' The gift always flows upward in seniority, never downward." },
    { title: "Buy low, sell high — SPV edition", text: "The SPV's whole business model is 'buy' (fund) at a low cost (notes to investors) and 'own' higher-yielding assets (receivables) — the spread between the two is the fuel for the whole structure." }

  summary: `<p><strong>True sale</strong>: the SPV's legal separateness from the originator is the foundational concept. <strong>Overcollateralization</strong>: pool assets exceed notes issued; the JUNIOR class absorbs this excess, protecting the SENIOR class (a frequently reversed fact). <strong>Three SPV structures</strong>: amortizing/pass-through (mortgages), revolving (credit cards/auto), master trust (multiple issuances, shared excess spread). <strong>Why securitize</strong>: funding diversification, capital relief, risk management. <strong>Credit enhancements</strong>: overcollateralization, pool insurance, subordination, margin step-up, excess spread. <strong>Performance ratios</strong>: delinquency ratio, default ratio, MPR (all /total pool balance); DSCR=NOI/debt payments; WAC=weighted coupon; WAM/WAL=weighted maturity/prepayment-adjusted life; CPR=1−(1−SMM)¹²; PSA benchmarks (100% = 0%→6% over 30 months). SPV liability side costs LESS than its asset side — that gap is the excess spread.</p>`
