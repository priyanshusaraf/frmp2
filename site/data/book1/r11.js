  title: "The Science of Term Structure Models",
  tagline: "The mechanical foundation — binomial trees, backward induction, risk-neutral pricing — that Readings 12-14 build increasingly sophisticated drift and volatility structures on top of.",

  teaches: `<p>Reading 10 hedged bonds empirically using historical regressions. This reading builds the theoretical machinery underneath: how to construct an arbitrage-free model of rate evolution, price bonds and options on that model, and understand the assumptions baked in — backward induction, true vs risk-neutral probabilities, option pricing via trees, OAS, recombining vs non-recombining trees, time-step trade-offs, and why BSM cannot be used for bonds.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Every derivative pricing model needs a way to evolve rates forward and discount cash flows back that is internally consistent (no arbitrage) AND matches observed market prices. The binomial tree with backward induction is the simplest object that does both — and it's the scaffold that Readings 12-14 will decorate with increasingly realistic drift and volatility assumptions.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>You can't value today's node without knowing tomorrow's possible values, and you can't know tomorrow's without knowing the day after — so you start at maturity (where value is certain) and work BACKWARD. At each node, bond value = the average of the two next-period present values (bond value + any coupon), discounted at that node's forward rate.</p>
  <p>The tree is built to be arbitrage-free: the model-computed price of an on-the-run bond must equal its ACTUAL market price. A tree is not "correct" just because it's internally consistent — it must also reconcile with the market, or it needs recalibration.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why must a rate tree be calibrated to be 'arbitrage-free,' and what specifically does that require?", a: "It requires the model-computed price of an on-the-run bond (using the tree's rates) to exactly equal that bond's observed market price — otherwise the tree, however internally consistent, is not usable for relative pricing and needs its rates recalibrated." },
    { q: "State the three specific reasons Black-Scholes-Merton cannot be used to price bonds.", a: "(1) BSM assumes no upper bound on the underlying's price, but bonds have a maximum value (rates at zero); (2) BSM assumes a constant risk-free rate, but bond payoffs are literally driven by changing rates; (3) BSM assumes constant volatility, but bond price volatility must fall to zero as maturity approaches (pull-to-par)." },
    { q: "You compute OAS = +40bp on a bond. What does this tell you about its market price relative to the model?", a: "OAS > 0 means the market price is LOWER than the model (pre-spread) price — the bond is trading cheap; you need to add 40bp to the discount rates to reconcile model and market prices." },
    { q: "Why does using true (50/50) probabilities instead of risk-neutral probabilities in backward induction usually fail to reproduce the market price?", a: "True probabilities reflect actual physical likelihood, ignoring the market's risk premium demanded for bearing rate risk. Risk-neutral probabilities (or equivalently, rate adjustments under 50/50 probabilities) bake that risk premium in — both approaches give the same, correct arbitrage-free price; naive 50/50 with unadjusted rates generally does not." },
    { q: "Sketch how a callable bond's price-yield relationship differs from an option-free bond's, and explain the reinvestment-risk consequence.", a: "Below the call-relevant yield y′, the callable bond's price is capped by the call price (negative convexity) — it can't rally as much as an option-free bond when rates fall. Above y′ it behaves like an ordinary option-free bond (positive convexity). The reinvestment consequence: investors get their principal back via the call exactly when rates (and reinvestment opportunities) are low." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Backward induction</strong>: value maturity first, walk backward; each node = discounted average of two successor values. Must be <strong>arbitrage-free</strong> (matches market price) or recalibrate. <strong>True vs risk-neutral probabilities</strong>: two equivalent ways to bake in the risk premium (adjust rates under 50/50, or adjust probabilities under given rates) — the gap between them IS the interest rate drift. <strong>Option pricing</strong>: price bond at every node → intrinsic value at maturity → discount back with risk-neutral probabilities; American features need every-node comparison. <strong>OAS</strong>: constant spread added to discount rates (not cash flows) to match market price; OAS>0 = cheap. <strong>Recombining vs non-recombining</strong> trees trade simplicity for realism. <strong>BSM fails for bonds</strong>: unbounded-price assumption, constant-rate assumption, constant-vol assumption all violated. <strong>Callable</strong> = negative convexity below y′ + reinvestment risk; <strong>putable</strong> = value floor above y′.</p>`
