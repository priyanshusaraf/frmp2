  title: "The Art of Term Structure Models: Volatility and Distribution",
  tagline: "Reading 13 varied the drift term across four models. This reading holds a similar structure but varies the VOLATILITY term instead.",

  teaches: `<p>First let volatility change deterministically over time (Model 3), then let volatility depend on the LEVEL of rates themselves (CIR and lognormal models) — which finally guarantees rates can never go negative. Ends with the additive-vs-multiplicative drift distinction and the Black-Karasinski model.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Model 1's biggest flaw wasn't just its drift — it was that constant volatility independent of the rate level allows rates to go negative, and produces a flat (unrealistic) volatility term structure. This reading's models fix that by making volatility itself either time-varying (useful for pricing caps/floors) or rate-level-dependent (useful for guaranteeing non-negative rates), and each fix has a genuinely different practical use case.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p><strong>Model 3</strong>: volatility decays exponentially from an initial σ toward 0 over time — especially useful for caps/floors, whose value depends critically on forecasted σ(t) at multiple future dates. Curious fact: under specific conditions (matching decay rate to Vasicek's mean-reversion rate), Model 3 and Vasicek can produce IDENTICAL terminal standard deviations — but Model 3 still implies parallel shifts (unlike Vasicek), so they're not the same model in disguise.</p>
  <p><strong>CIR and lognormal</strong>: volatility depends on the LEVEL of rates. CIR: basis-point vol increases with √r (at a decreasing rate); yield vol is NOT constant; cannot go negative. Lognormal (Model 4): basis-point vol increases linearly with r (=σr); yield vol IS constant (=σ); cannot go negative. Don't confuse "basis point volatility" (vol of the level change dr) with "yield volatility" (vol of the percentage change) — CIR has NEITHER constant, but lognormal has constant YIELD vol even though its basis-point vol still increases with rate level.</p>
  <p><strong>Additive vs multiplicative drift</strong>: Ho-Lee's drift terms are ADDITIVE (dr = λ(t)dt + …); the lognormal model's drift, modeled in log-space, translates to a MULTIPLICATIVE effect on actual rates (since e^x ≈ 1+x for small x). Get the direction right — lognormal is multiplicative, not Ho-Lee.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A colleague says 'CIR and lognormal both have constant volatility, so they're basically the same.' Correct this.", a: "Neither has ALL volatility measures constant. Lognormal has constant YIELD volatility (σ) but basis-point volatility still rises linearly with the rate level. CIR has NEITHER constant — both basis-point and yield volatility vary with the rate level (basis-point vol rises with √r at a decreasing rate). They are meaningfully different models." },
    { q: "Why can Model 3 match Vasicek's terminal standard deviation under specific calibration, yet still be a fundamentally different model?", a: "Because terminal SD is just one summary statistic. Model 3 still implies PARALLEL shifts across the curve (like Model 1), while Vasicek implies NONPARALLEL shifts (mean-reversion dampens long-horizon impact) — a structurally different volatility term structure despite matching one number." },
    { q: "Explain precisely why the lognormal model's drift is described as 'multiplicative' even though it's written additively.", a: "The lognormal model's drift is additive in LOG-space: d ln(r) = λ(t)dt + σdw. But because e^x ≈ 1+x for small x, an additive change in ln(r) translates into a MULTIPLICATIVE change in the actual rate r itself — the opposite of Ho-Lee, whose drift acts additively on the rate directly." },
    { q: "Why is CIR (and lognormal) preferred over Model 1/Vasicek for modeling rates that must stay non-negative?", a: "Both make volatility depend on the LEVEL of the rate (CIR: σ√r; lognormal: effectively σr in basis-point terms) — as r approaches zero, volatility shrinks toward zero too, preventing the rate from being pushed negative. Model 1 and Vasicek have volatility independent of the rate level, so they always carry positive probability of negative rates." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Same number, different model", text: "Model 3 and Vasicek can agree on 'terminal standard deviation' the way two students can get the same final exam score by studying completely different material — one number matching doesn't make the underlying process identical." },
    { title: "Log-space addition, rate-space multiplication", text: "Lognormal's drift adds in log-space but multiplies in rate-space — like adding exponents multiplies the underlying numbers. Ho-Lee skips the log entirely and adds directly." },
    { title: "The volatility that protects against zero", text: "CIR and lognormal both shrink volatility as the rate approaches zero — like a car automatically slowing down as it nears a cliff edge, mechanically preventing it from going over (negative)." }
  ],

  summary: `<p><strong>Model 3</strong>: time-decaying volatility (useful for caps/floors); can match Vasicek's terminal SD under specific calibration but still implies PARALLEL shifts (different from Vasicek's nonparallel shifts) — matching one statistic ≠ being the same model. <strong>CIR</strong> (dr=k(θ−r)dt+σ√r·dw): basis-point vol rises with √r (decreasing rate), yield vol NOT constant, cannot go negative. <strong>Lognormal</strong> (d ln r=λ(t)dt+σdw): basis-point vol rises linearly with r, yield vol CONSTANT (σ), cannot go negative — the CIR/lognormal distinction on WHICH volatility is constant is the most tested fact here. <strong>Additive vs multiplicative drift</strong>: Ho-Lee is additive on the rate; lognormal is additive in log-space, hence multiplicative on the actual rate — Black-Karasinski (lognormal + mean reversion) inherits Vasicek's non-recombining tree problem.</p>`
