  session: "Correlation Risk",
  title: "Correlation Basics",
  tagline: "Study Session 1 treated correlation as an input you already have. Now: where does correlation risk come from, how do you price bets ON correlation, and how did correlation misunderstanding help cause 2008?",

  teaches: `<p>This reading surveys correlation as a risk in its own right: portfolio mean/variance foundations, wrong-way risk in CDS, correlation options and swaps, how correlation drives VaR, the 2008 correlation-trading mechanism, and concentration/systemic risk. Readings 8-9 go deep on the empirics and modeling machinery.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Diversification is the only "free lunch" in finance — but its size depends entirely on correlation, which is not a fixed physical constant. Traders built entire product lines betting explicitly on correlation (correlation swaps, tranche trades). When those bets went wrong in 2005 and 2008, correlation misunderstanding was at the center — not just a side detail. This reading is the origin story for why correlation gets its own three-reading study session.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Correlation shows up in two very different guises: (1) as an INPUT that shrinks portfolio risk (the diversification benefit), and (2) as an ASSET in itself that products are built to bet on. Wrong-way risk is the nasty case where these two roles collide — your hedge's payout probability is correlated with your hedge's ability to pay, so the insurance evaporates exactly when you need it.</p>`,

      counter: "The one notable EXCEPTION: an option on the WORSE-OF two assets — there, LOWER correlation reduces the price (more dispersion increases the chance one asset is bad, hurting a worse-of payoff). Quanto options: lower correlation between underlying and FX rate → HIGHER quanto price.",

      example: "May 2005, GM/Ford downgraded to junk: equity tranche spreads INCREASED (losses on the long leg) while mezzanine tranche CORRELATIONS DECREASED, lowering mezzanine spreads too (the short leg's spread should have risen to profit them — instead it fell). Both legs lost money simultaneously — the opposite of what a hedge should do.",

  recall: [
    { q: "Why is wrong-way risk described as insurance that evaporates exactly when needed?", a: "The CDS protection seller's solvency is positively correlated with the reference entity's default — so the moment the reference defaults (protection is needed), the seller is also more likely to be unable to pay." },
    { q: "In the 2008 tranche trade, why did the mezzanine (short) leg lose money instead of gaining?", a: "Mezzanine tranche correlation FELL after the GM/Ford downgrade, which lowered mezzanine spreads. A short position profits when spreads RISE; falling spreads meant the short leg lost money too — the opposite of what the 'hedge' was supposed to do." },
    { q: "A bank splits a $10M loan into ten $1M loans, same total PD, but default correlation stays at 1.0. Does expected loss change?", a: "No — at correlation 1, the ten small loans behave exactly like the one large loan in every default scenario. Concentration ratio fell but correlation didn't, so worst-case loss is unchanged." },
    { q: "Name the one payoff type where lower asset correlation LOWERS the option price, and explain why.", a: "An option on the worse-of two assets. Lower correlation increases dispersion, raising the chance that AT LEAST ONE asset performs badly — which is exactly the scenario that hurts a worse-of payoff, so the price falls rather than rises." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Portfolio variance</strong> σ_P² = w_X²σ_X² + w_Y²σ_Y² + 2w_Xw_Yσ_Xσ_Yρ — diversification benefit is continuous, not step-like. <strong>Wrong-way risk</strong>: reference asset and counterparty solvency positively correlated; spread-correlation relationship is non-monotonic. <strong>Correlation products</strong>: lower ρ → higher option price generally, EXCEPT worse-of options (reversed) and quanto options (lower ρ between underlying/FX → higher price). <strong>VaR rises with correlation</strong>; Basel requires capital ≥ 3× 10-day VaR. <strong>2008 mechanism</strong>: long equity tranche + short mezzanine, both legs lost simultaneously as equity spreads rose and mezzanine correlation (and spreads) fell — the copula models (R9) misunderstood tranche correlation dynamics. <strong>Concentration + default correlation</strong> must BOTH fall to reduce worst-case loss; splitting exposures alone (correlation unchanged) does nothing.</p>`
