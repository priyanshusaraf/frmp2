  title: "Estimating Market Risk Measures",
  tagline: "How to turn a pile of P&L data into one defensible number: 'this is how much we could lose.' Everything else in Part II calibrates, stress-tests, or regulates this number.",

  teaches: `<p>This is the foundation reading of the entire curriculum. It teaches you to compute <strong>Value at Risk (VaR)</strong> three ways — directly from sorted historical data, from a normal distribution, and from a lognormal distribution — and then to fix VaR's biggest blind spot with <strong>Expected Shortfall (ES)</strong>. It closes with two honesty tools: standard errors (how precise is my risk number?) and QQ plots (is my distributional assumption even right?).</p>
  <p>Think of this reading as building a ruler. The rest of Book 1 calibrates the ruler (R2), extends it to catastrophes (R3), audits it (R4), and finally replaces its markings by regulation (R16).</p>`,

  why: `<p>Every risk management decision — how much capital to hold, whether a trade is too risky, whether a bank's model is trustworthy — starts with a single question: <strong>"how much could we lose, and how confident are we in that number?"</strong> Before VaR existed, firms described risk position-by-position with Greeks and notionals that couldn't be added up. VaR was invented to give one firm-wide, probability-based loss number a CEO or regulator can act on. ES was invented roughly a decade later because VaR turned out to answer the wrong question about tails — and that gap between the two is now written into bank regulation (FRTB, R16).</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Line up your last 1,000 daily P&L outcomes from worst to best. Walk in 5% of the way from the worst end. The loss you're standing on is your 95% VaR: <em>"on 95% of days we do better than this."</em></p>
  <p>Now notice what VaR ignores: everything to your left. Whether the worst 5% of days lose a little more than VaR or lose ten times VaR — VaR is identical. <strong>ES walks into that left tail and takes the average.</strong> That's the whole conceptual difference: VaR is a threshold, ES is the average severity beyond the threshold. Two portfolios can have identical VaR and wildly different ES — and it's the ES-difference that kills institutions.</p>
  <p>The parametric versions just replace the sorted data with a smooth curve (normal for P&L, lognormal when prices can't go negative) so the quantile comes from a formula instead of a ranking.</p>`,

      intuition: "Arithmetic is fine when the horizon is short and moves are small. Geometric is the honest choice for longer horizons — and it's the mathematical cousin of the lognormal VaR model.",
      example: "For small returns the two are nearly identical (ln(1.02) ≈ 0.0198). The gap widens with big moves and long horizons.",

      intuition: "Zero distributional assumptions: the data IS the distribution. That's its strength (handles skew and fat tails automatically) and its weakness (it can't imagine anything worse than what already happened).",
      example: "1,000 monthly returns, 95% → 51st worst. If that return is −15.5% on a $1,000,000 position, monthly VaR = $155,000.",

      def: "Assume a distribution for P&L (normal) or returns (lognormal); VaR falls out of the distribution's quantile formula instead of the empirical ranking.",
      intuition: "You trade data-hunger for assumption-risk. The formula needs only μ and σ — but if the true tail is fatter than normal, your VaR is systematically too small in exactly the states that matter.",
      example: "Annual P&L ~ N($15M, $10M²): VaR(5%) = −15 + 10(1.65) = $1.5M; VaR(1%) = −15 + 10(2.33) = $8.3M. Deeper confidence ⇒ larger VaR, always.",

      intuition: "The general recipe says: express how much you dislike each part of the loss distribution, then average with those dislikes as weights. ES's 'dislike function' is an indicator: only the tail counts, equally.",

  misconceptions: [
    { wrong: "\"VaR tells you how bad losses can get at the 95% level.\"", right: "VaR tells you the best of the worst 5% — a threshold, not a worst case. It says nothing about severity beyond itself; that's ES's job." },

    { wrong: "\"The QQ plot proves returns are non-normal.\"", right: "QQ plots are visual diagnostics — they suggest, identify, inspect. 'Test' or 'prove' language is the trap." },
    { wrong: "\"Lognormal VaR and normal VaR should give clearly different answers.\"", right: "For small σ and short horizons they converge (e^x ≈ 1+x). Recognizing convergence is itself a tested skill." },
    { wrong: "\"More extreme quantiles are always estimated less precisely.\"", right: "SE depends on p(1−p)/f(q)² — p(1−p) is maximized at p=0.5. The real problem with deep tails is fewer supporting data points, which is the EVT motivation, not the SE formula per se." }

  recall: [
    { q: "Explain to a non-quant colleague why two portfolios with identical 95% VaR can have very different risk.", a: "VaR only marks the threshold where the worst 5% begins. One portfolio's tail might lose 1.1× VaR on bad days, another's 10× VaR. ES exposes this because it averages the tail; VaR is blind to it by construction." },
    { q: "You have 500 daily returns and want 99% HS VaR. Which observation do you take, and what's the ambiguity?", a: "0.01×500 = 5 tail observations; book convention takes the (5+1) = 6th worst. Some exams use the 5th worst (αn). Follow the stated convention; default to (αn)+1." },
    { q: "Why does the lognormal model guarantee prices can't go negative — and when does that guarantee stop mattering numerically?", a: "Returns are modeled as ln(P₁/P₀), so the implied price is P₀·e^r > 0 always. For small σ/short horizons e^x ≈ 1+x, so lognormal and normal VaR converge — the guarantee is there but the numbers barely differ." },
    { q: "What happens to the SE of a quantile estimate if you increase the bin width h?", a: "Wider bins capture more probability mass, raising f(q), which sits in the denominator — so SE falls and the confidence interval narrows." },
    { q: "Why is ES described as 'the average of VaRs'? What limit makes this exact?", a: "Slice the tail into n equal-probability slices and average the VaR at each slice boundary; as n→∞ the average converges to E[L | L > VaR], the true ES." }

  summary: `<p><strong>VaR</strong> = the loss threshold at a confidence level; compute it by ranking history (HS), or from −μ+σz (normal P&L), or P₀[1−e^(μ−σz)] (lognormal returns). <strong>ES</strong> = average loss beyond VaR; always ≥ VaR; it's the tail-severity fix and the future regulatory standard. <strong>Coherent measures</strong> generalize ES with arbitrary quantile weights. Every estimate carries a <strong>standard error</strong> — know the n/h/p directions. <strong>QQ plots</strong> visually diagnose (never 'prove') distributional fit and reveal the fat tails that motivate the rest of the book. Sign convention: losses quoted positive. Ranking convention: (αn)+1, but follow the question.</p>`
