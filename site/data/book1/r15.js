  title: "Volatility Smiles",
  tagline: "If Black-Scholes-Merton were exactly right, implied volatility would be flat across all strikes. It isn't — and the SHAPE of the departure tells you what the market believes about the true distribution.",

  teaches: `<p>Readings 11-14 built term-structure models for rates. This reading pivots to a parallel idea for options generally: put-call parity forces equal implied vol for calls and puts at the same strike; the three named shapes (smile, skew, frown) each imply a different true distribution and have different causes; alternative parameterizations and vol surfaces; and the impact on the Greeks.</p>`,

  why: `<p>If markets truly believed lognormal returns (BSM's assumption), every option on the same underlying and maturity would trade at the same implied volatility regardless of strike. They don't — and the specific pattern of disagreement is a direct, tradeable readout of what the market believes about fat tails, skewness, and jump risk. This is BSM's constant-volatility assumption failing exactly the way Reading 11 warned it would for bonds — now for options generally.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Put-call parity is a pure no-arbitrage relationship — it holds regardless of the true underlying distribution. So any deviation of market price from the BSM price must be IDENTICAL in dollar terms for a call and a put at the same strike/maturity. This mechanically FORCES implied volatility for a call and put at the same strike to be equal — not an empirical observation, a model-independent fact.</p>
  <p>The shape itself is diagnostic: a <strong>smile</strong> (FX options) means fatter tails on BOTH sides than lognormal — driven by volatility jumps/regime shifts. A <strong>skew/smirk</strong> (equity options) means left-skewed risk — down moves feared more than up moves — driven by the leverage effect (falling equity → higher leverage → higher vol) AND "crashophobia" (post-1987 fear premium on OTM puts, which is about the PRICE of protection, not a claim that realized volatility itself rises). A <strong>frown</strong> means an anticipated binary/news event making the outcome bimodal — the mirror image of a smile.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Why must a call and a put at the same strike and maturity have the same implied volatility?", a: "Put-call parity is a model-independent, no-arbitrage relationship. Any gap between market and BSM price must be identical in dollar terms for the call and put, which mechanically forces their implied volatilities (backed out from that same price gap) to match." },
    { q: "An equity index shows a pronounced downside skew. Name the two distinct causes and explain the difference between them.", a: "Leverage effect: a falling equity price mechanically raises the firm's financial leverage, genuinely increasing volatility. Crashophobia: a risk-aversion premium embedded in the PRICE of deep OTM puts (post-1987 fear of another crash), independent of whether realized volatility itself has risen." },
    { q: "Why is the minimum variance delta systematically lower than the standard BSM delta for equity options?", a: "Standard BSM delta only captures the effect of moving along the existing smile curve as price changes. But equity price and volatility are typically negatively correlated, so the WHOLE smile curve tends to shift when price moves — this dominant second effect is captured only by the minimum variance delta, pulling it below standard delta." },
    { q: "A currency pair shows a symmetric smile while an equity index shows a downside skew. What does this difference say about each market's implied distribution?", a: "The FX smile implies fat tails on BOTH sides relative to lognormal — extreme moves are seen as more likely in either direction (volatility jumps/regime shifts). The equity skew implies a left-skewed distribution — down moves are seen as more likely/severe than up moves, driven by leverage and crashophobia." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Three faces, three moods", text: "Smile: nervous about both directions (FX). Skew/smirk: nervous specifically about falling (equities — leverage + crashophobia). Frown: expecting a coin-flip verdict (binary news event) — the opposite curvature of a smile." },
    { title: "Parity's iron law", text: "Put-call parity is the law that says a call and put at the same strike must quote the same implied vol — no exceptions, no empirical wiggle room, because it's arbitrage, not opinion." },
    { title: "The whole smile moves", text: "Standard delta watches you walk along a hallway (the smile curve). Minimum variance delta notices the whole hallway is also sliding sideways — and that sliding is usually the bigger effect." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Put-call parity</strong> mechanically forces equal implied vol for same-strike calls/puts — a no-arbitrage fact, not an empirical claim. <strong>Smile</strong> (FX): fat tails both sides, vol jumps/regime shifts. <strong>Skew/smirk</strong> (equity): down-side feared more — leverage effect (genuine vol rise) + crashophobia (pricing premium only). <strong>Frown</strong>: anticipated binary event, ATM richer than wings — opposite of a smile. Parameterizations: X/S₀, X alone, X/F₀ (often preferred), or delta. <strong>Vol surface</strong> = smile × term structure. <strong>Greeks</strong>: standard BSM delta only tracks movement along the smile; the DOMINANT effect is the whole smile shifting (price-vol negative correlation), captured by the systematically LOWER minimum variance delta.</p>`
