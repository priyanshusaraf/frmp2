  title: "The Art of Term Structure Models: Drift",
  tagline: "The formula-heaviest reading in the book — one continuous idea told in four increasingly flexible versions, each a strict generalization of the one before.",

  teaches: `<p>Start with a model that has no opinion about direction (Model 1), add a constant expected direction (Model 2), let that direction vary by time period (Ho-Lee), then let it actively pull back toward a long-run anchor (Vasicek). Each model nests the one before it: Model 1 ⊂ Model 2 ⊂ Ho-Lee, and Vasicek is a structurally different (mean-reverting) branch.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Reading 11 built the tree scaffold; Reading 12 explained why yields have their shape via expectations and convexity. Now: what should the DRIFT term inside the tree actually look like? Different drift assumptions produce curves with dramatically different shapes, volatility-term-structure implications, and (crucially) different probabilities of negative rates — a real modeling concern that shaped a decade of rates-market practice.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Think of the four models as a family tree of increasing ambition:</p>
  <p><strong>Model 1</strong> (no drift): recombining tree, symmetric 50/50 up/down, dr = σdw. Limitations: flat volatility term structure (real markets show a hump), only one risk factor (parallel shifts only), and always positive probability of negative rates.</p>
  <p><strong>Model 2</strong> (constant drift): adds constant λ combining risk premium + expected rate change. Tree still recombines. Better fits upward-sloping curves, but a single constant risk premium forever is a stretch for long horizons.</p>
  <p><strong>Ho-Lee</strong> (time-dependent drift): λ(t) can differ every period, each calibrated to the observed market rate for that maturity — more flexible, and Model 2 is the special case where all λ_t are equal.</p>
  <p><strong>Vasicek</strong> (mean reversion): adds k(θ−r), actively pulling the rate back toward long-run mean θ at speed k. This is the FIRST model whose tree does NOT naturally recombine — because the reversion adjustment depends on how far the current rate already is from θ, so up-then-down ≠ down-then-up.</p>`,

    { wrong: "\"All four drift models produce recombining trees.\"", right: "Model 1, Model 2, and Ho-Lee all recombine. Vasicek does NOT recombine naturally — because its drift adjustment depends on distance from θ, which differs by path." },
    { wrong: "\"Ho-Lee and Model 2 are essentially different models.\"", right: "Ho-Lee nests Model 2 exactly: if all λ_t are equal, Ho-Lee IS Model 2. And if λ=0, Model 2 IS Model 1. It's one nested family, not four unrelated models." },

  recall: [
    { q: "If Ho-Lee's calibrated λ_t values turn out identical across all periods, what model do you actually have?", a: "Model 2 (constant drift) — Ho-Lee nests Model 2 exactly as the special case where all time-varying drift terms are equal." },
    { q: "Why does Vasicek's tree fail to recombine while Model 1/2/Ho-Lee's trees do?", a: "Vasicek's drift adjustment k(θ−r) depends on how far the CURRENT rate already is from θ — a path-dependent quantity. Up-then-down and down-then-up traverse different intermediate rates, so they land on different final rates, breaking recombination. The drift-only models (1, 2, Ho-Lee) have no such path dependence." },
    { q: "Explain in one sentence why Vasicek produces a DECLINING volatility term structure.", a: "Mean reversion actively pulls rates back toward θ, and this pull compounds over time, dampening the accumulated uncertainty at long horizons relative to short ones — so long-horizon rate volatility ends up lower than short-horizon volatility." },
    { q: "You need to identify whether a specific bond is cheap or rich relative to the rest of the curve. Should you reach for an arbitrage-free or an equilibrium model, and why?", a: "Equilibrium model — arbitrage-free models are calibrated to already match observed market prices exactly, so by construction they can't flag any security as mispriced relative to the model." },
    { q: "Model 1 has three named limitations. State them and explain which one Vasicek specifically fixes.", a: "Flat volatility term structure, single risk factor (parallel shifts only), and positive probability of negative rates. Vasicek fixes the flat-vol-term-structure limitation by producing a declining term structure via mean reversion (though it still allows negative rates and — like Model 1 — is a one-factor model)." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The family tree", text: "Model 1 has no opinion. Model 2 picks a direction and never changes its mind. Ho-Lee changes its mind every period. Vasicek is the rebellious cousin who actively pulls back toward home (θ) — and is the only one whose tree won't sit still (recombine)." },
    { title: "The rubber band", text: "k in Vasicek is rubber-band stiffness. Big k: rates snap back to θ fast, shocks are short-lived. Small k: a loose rubber band, shocks linger." },
    { title: "One idea, four costumes", text: "dr = σdw → +λdt → +λ(t)dt → +k(θ−r)dt. Same σdw core noise term in every model; only the drift costume changes." }
  ],

  summary: `<p>Four nested drift models, same σdw noise term throughout. <strong>Model 1</strong> (dr=σdw): recombining, symmetric, flat vol term structure, one factor, can go negative. <strong>Model 2</strong> (+λdt): constant drift, still recombines, fits upward slopes but λ can be unrealistically large/permanent. <strong>Ho-Lee</strong> (+λ(t)dt): time-varying drift calibrated per maturity; nests Model 2 (λ_t constant) which nests Model 1 (λ=0). <strong>Vasicek</strong> (+k(θ−r)dt): mean-reverting; DOES NOT recombine (path-dependent); produces a DECLINING (not flat) volatility term structure and nonparallel shifts — the single most confused fact across R11-14. <strong>Arbitrage-free</strong> models match market prices exactly (useless for relative value); <strong>equilibrium</strong> models are needed to flag cheap/rich securities.</p>`
