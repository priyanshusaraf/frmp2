  session: "Risk Measurement",
  title: "Messages From the Academic Literature",
  tagline: "A conceptual bridge chapter — the research verdict on VaR's blind spots, previewing themes that get built out fully in later books.",

  teaches: `<p>Almost entirely qualitative, no heavy formulas. This reading previews liquidity risk, stressed VaR, integrated capital, and VaR's mathematical flaws — themes that Books 1-5 will build out fully. Treat it as the research-summary chapter between the VaR toolkit (R1-5) and correlation risk (R7-9).</p>`,

  why: `<p>Regulators and risk managers don't just need formulas — they need to know where the formulas' assumptions break. This reading collects the academic community's verdict on VaR's mathematical flaws (non-subadditivity), the liquidity dimension VaR ignores, and the aggregation question (does compartmentalized risk measurement over- or under-state true risk?). Every theme here resurfaces as a fully built-out topic later.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Think of this as the research memo a regulator reads before deciding to replace VaR with ES (R16). The single most important idea: <strong>VaR is not subadditive</strong> — a merged portfolio's VaR can exceed the sum of its parts' VaRs. That's a mathematical failure, not just a practical inconvenience: it means VaR can penalize diversification, the opposite of what a risk measure should do. ES fixes this by construction.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Give a concrete scenario where VaR violates subadditivity.", a: "Two positions each with small VaR individually (e.g., digital options with small probability of large loss) can combine into a merged position whose VaR captures a scenario neither alone triggers, making merged VaR exceed the sum — precisely the failure ES avoids by averaging over the whole tail." },
    { q: "Why is 'ignoring time-varying volatility' and 'incorporating time-varying volatility' both criticized in the literature?", a: "Ignoring it understates risk in a volatility upswing (using a stale, low-vol estimate). Incorporating it makes VaR procyclical and jumpier — right before a crisis it may spike, right after may fall too fast; there's no clean free lunch." },
    { q: "Distinguish exogenous and endogenous liquidity risk with an example each.", a: "Exogenous: the bid-ask spread on a stock, the same for any trader regardless of size — priced via LVaR spread add-on. Endogenous: a hedge fund trying to unwind a position so large it moves the price against itself — requires modeling its own price impact." },
    { q: "Explain the leverage-procyclicality feedback loop in one sentence.", a: "Booms raise net worth, loosening VaR-based capital constraints and enabling more borrowing; busts shrink net worth, tightening constraints and forcing asset sales into an already-falling market, which is a spiral VaR-based regulation can amplify rather than dampen." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The subadditivity flag", text: "'VaR is not subadditive' is Book 1's single most reusable exam sentence — plant it early. Every time ES appears as 'the fix,' this is the flaw being fixed." },

  summary: `<p>Qualitative bridge reading. <strong>No universal VaR horizon</strong> — 10-day is convention. <strong>Time-varying volatility</strong>: ignore it → understated risk; model it → procyclical, noisier VaR. <strong>Exogenous liquidity</strong> (market-wide spread, LVaR) vs <strong>endogenous liquidity</strong> (your own trade moves the price). <strong>VaR is not subadditive</strong> (can penalize diversification) — ES is always subadditive; spectral measures generalize ES with a full weighting function. Basel's <strong>compartmentalized</strong> risk aggregation ignores cross-risk-type interactions. <strong>Top-down</strong> aggregation studies find diversification; <strong>bottom-up</strong> studies are mixed, sometimes finding compounding. <strong>Leverage-procyclicality</strong>: VaR-based capital rules can amplify boom-bust cycles via forced deleveraging.</p>`
