  title: "VaR Mapping",
  tagline: "Real portfolios have thousands of positions. Mapping replaces each one with its exposure to a small set of common risk factors, so the Reading 1-4 machinery can run on a manageable number of variables.",

  teaches: `<p>Mapping is the bridge between the single-P&L-series machinery of Readings 1-4 and real, thousand-position portfolios. You learn why mapping is necessary, the general-vs-specific risk trade-off, three fixed-income mapping methods of increasing precision, stress testing via undiversified VaR, tracking error VaR, and how mapping extends to derivatives.</p>`,

  why: `<p>You cannot backtest, stress-test, or even estimate a covariance matrix for 5,000 individual stocks — that's ~12.5 million pairwise covariances. Mapping exists so that all the VaR/ES/backtesting machinery built in Readings 1-4 can be applied to a manageable handful of risk factors (an equity index, a set of yield curve points, an FX rate) instead of every individual position.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Mapping is a translation exercise: instead of describing a bond by its unique cash flows, describe it by its exposure to a handful of shared risk factors — points on the yield curve, an equity index, a currency. Once every position speaks the same risk-factor language, you can add, net, and correlate them.</p>
  <p>The central trade-off is <strong>precision vs manageability</strong>: more risk factors shrink the unexplained ("specific") risk but cost more computation. Specific risk is NOT a fixed property of an asset — it shrinks every time you add a finer risk factor (duration-only → +credit factor → +currency factor). Fixed-income mapping shows this literally: principal mapping (crudest, one number) → duration mapping (better) → full cash-flow mapping (most precise, captures genuine diversification across maturities).</p>`,

      pitfall: "Specific risk is NOT a fixed, intrinsic property of an asset — it's a function of how finely you define general risk. Adding a credit factor, then a currency factor, to a bond model keeps shrinking 'specific risk' further. Treating it as unchangeable is the tested trap.",

Duration mapping: whole portfolio to a zero-coupon bond of matching duration (better, still one number).

      example: "$100M 1-year (3.5% coupon) + $100M 5-year (5% coupon): principal mapping avg life 3yr → VaR $2.968M; duration mapping (duration 2.768yr) → $2.737M; cash-flow undiversified → $2.674M; cash-flow diversified (true correlations) → $2.615M.

  recall: [
    { q: "Why can't you just run historical simulation on 5,000 individual stock positions directly?", a: "You'd need the full covariance structure across 5,000 assets (~12.5M pairwise covariances) — computationally and statistically infeasible. Mapping each stock to a factor (e.g., market β) collapses this to a tractable few factors." },
    { q: "A bond portfolio's duration-only model shows high 'specific risk.' You add a credit-spread factor. What happens to specific risk, and why doesn't this mean the bond became less risky?", a: "Specific risk shrinks — some of what was unexplained is now captured by the new factor. Total risk is unchanged; you've just relabeled part of 'specific' as 'general.' Specific risk is a modeling artifact, not an asset property." },
    { q: "Why does cash-flow mapping (diversified) produce a lower VaR than principal mapping for the same bond portfolio?", a: "Principal mapping crudely lumps everything at one weighted-average maturity, implicitly assuming perfect co-movement. Diversified cash-flow mapping captures the true (imperfect) correlation between different points on the curve, revealing real diversification benefit that cruder methods hide." },
    { q: "Explain how a portfolio can have the lowest absolute VaR yet the highest tracking error against its benchmark.", a: "Absolute VaR depends on the portfolio's own risk; tracking error depends on how differently it moves from the BENCHMARK. A very low-risk portfolio built very differently from a higher-risk benchmark (e.g., barbell vs bullet duration profile) can minimize its own VaR while maximizing its divergence from the benchmark." },
    { q: "Why does delta-normal VaR understate risk for options over a long horizon?", a: "Delta-normal is a linear (first-order) approximation valid only while delta itself stays roughly constant. Over a long horizon or big price move, delta shifts meaningfully (gamma effects), so the linear approximation misses the actual nonlinear payoff risk." }

    { title: "Snapshot vs movie", text: "Delta-normal VaR is a single photograph of an option's sensitivity; a big move or long horizon needs the whole movie (full revaluation) to see how that sensitivity itself changes." }

  summary: `<p>Mapping replaces many positions with exposures to a handful of shared risk factors so R1-4's machinery becomes tractable. <strong>General vs specific risk</strong>: specific risk shrinks as factors get finer — it is not fixed. <strong>Fixed-income mapping</strong>, coarse to fine: principal (weighted-avg life) → duration (single zero match) → cash-flow (every payment mapped, correlations included) — precision typically lowers VaR by revealing diversification. <strong>Undiversified VaR</strong> (Σ|xᵢ|Vᵢ, ρ=1) is a stress-test upper bound; <strong>diversified VaR</strong> uses the true correlation matrix. <strong>Tracking error VaR</strong> (vs benchmark) can move opposite to absolute VaR — barbell vs bullet is the classic case. <strong>Derivatives</strong>: linear instruments (forwards/swaps) map cleanly; options need delta-normal (fast, first-order, breaks down over long horizons) or full revaluation/delta-gamma.</p>`
