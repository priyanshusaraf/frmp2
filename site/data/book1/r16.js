  title: "Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB)",
  tagline: "The capstone: every earlier thread in Book 1 gets cashed in by regulation. Here is what banks must actually hold capital against, and why the old answer wasn't good enough.",

  teaches: `<p>This reading is where VaR's non-subadditivity and blindness to tail severity (R1, R6) directly motivate FRTB's replacement of VaR with Expected Shortfall. Backtesting weaknesses (R4) shape FRTB's specific backtesting and P&L attribution rules. Correlation-across-liquidity-horizons (Study Session 2) motivates the multi-horizon liquidity structure. You'll learn liquidity horizons, trading book vs banking book classification, backtesting/P&L attribution under FRTB, and credit risk/securitization treatment.</p>`,

  why: `<p>If Study Session 1 asked "how do we measure risk," Reading 16 is regulators' final answer: "here is what banks must actually hold capital against, and why the old answer wasn't good enough." Every conceptual flaw flagged earlier in the book — VaR's blindness to tail severity, non-subadditivity, single-horizon assumptions, weak backtesting — gets a specific regulatory fix here.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>The canonical motivating case makes the whole chapter's purpose vivid: a $950M bond portfolio, 2% annual default probability, discretized as 3-in-5 chance of $0 loss, 2-in-5 chance of total ($950M) loss conditional on being in the bad tail. At 95% confidence, VaR = $0 (default probability is below 5%, so the threshold loss is zero) — VaR says "no problem." But ES = 40% × $950M = $380M — ES correctly captures that IF you're in the tail, the loss is catastrophic. This gap between a reassuring VaR and an alarming ES is exactly the scenario FRTB was designed to prevent regulators from missing.</p>
  <p>Under a normal distribution, 99% VaR and 97.5% ES are numerically very close (2.326σ vs 2.338σ above the mean) — but they diverge sharply under fat-tailed distributions, which is the whole point of preferring ES.</p>`,

    { wrong: "\"Stressed ES gets backtested the same way regular VaR does.\"", right: "Stressed ES is explicitly NOT backtested (its extreme conditions won't recur with testable frequency) — ordinary VaR is still what gets backtested, at 99% or 97.5% confidence over the latest 12 months." },
    { wrong: "\"P&L attribution and backtesting are the same test with different names.\"", right: "They are two separate, coexisting audits: backtesting counts exception days against VaR; P&L attribution compares the risk model's overall predicted P&L to the desk's actual P&L via the D/A ratio and variance ratio." },

  recall: [
    { q: "Walk through why the $950M portfolio example gives VaR = $0 at 95% confidence despite a real risk of catastrophic loss.", a: "The annual default probability is 2%, which is below the 5% tail cutoff at 95% confidence — so the 95th percentile loss outcome falls in the 'no default' scenario, giving VaR = $0. ES, by averaging over the WHOLE tail (including the 2% default scenario), correctly captures the 40% conditional loss probability × $950M = $380M expected tail loss." },
    { q: "What does ES₃ specifically hold fixed and shock, in the FRTB liquidity-horizon waterfall?", a: "ES₃ holds liquidity categories 1 and 2 fixed (not re-shocked) while shocking categories 3, 4, and 5 — each successive ES_k in the waterfall retires an earlier, shorter-horizon category from being re-shocked, reflecting that its risk has already been captured at its own (shorter) horizon." },
    { q: "A bank has 15 VaR exceptions at 99% confidence over the past 12 months, and its P&L attribution D/A ratio is within ±10%. What happens?", a: "15 exceptions exceeds the 12-exception limit at 99% confidence, so the bank is forced onto the standardized approach for backtesting purposes — regardless of the P&L attribution result, since these are two separate, independently-failing tests." },
    { q: "Why does FRTB use a 99% VaR (not ES) specifically for jump-to-default risk, separate from the 97.5% ES general market risk charge?", a: "Default is a discrete, binary jump event rather than a continuous mark-to-market process — a fundamentally different risk shape than spread risk. FRTB deliberately keeps these as two separate measures at two separate confidence levels rather than forcing one framework to describe both risk types." }

    { title: "The waterfall", text: "ES₁ shocks everything. ES₂ 'retires' the fastest-moving category and shocks the rest. ES₃ retires two, shocks the remaining three. Each step peels off a faster liquidity horizon like a waterfall dropping down a level." },
    { title: "Two report cards", text: "Backtesting is the exception-count report card (inherited from R4). P&L attribution is a NEW, separate report card asking 'does the model's whole P&L story match reality?' Two report cards, two ways to fail." }

  summary: `<p>FRTB is the regulatory capstone cashing in every Book 1 thread. <strong>Motivating case</strong>: 2% default prob portfolio → VaR₉₅%=$0, ES=$380M — VaR's tail-blindness (R1, R6) made concrete. <strong>Liquidity horizons</strong>: 10/20/40/60/120 days replace one horizon; IMA computes ES₁-ES₅ waterfall, √t-scaled. <strong>Trading vs banking book</strong>: dual test (can trade + actively managed); reclassification heavily restricted (anti-arbitrage). <strong>Backtesting</strong> (VaR exceptions, 99%/97.5%, 12/30 limits) is SEPARATE from <strong>P&L attribution</strong> (D/A ratio ±10%, variance ratio <20%) — two independent audits. <strong>Credit risk</strong>: 97.5% ES for spread risk vs 99% VaR (1-year) for jump-to-default — two different measures for two different risk shapes; securitizations move to a standardized approach.</p>`
