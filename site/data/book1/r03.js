  tagline: "Stop fitting the whole distribution and hoping the tail comes out right. Fit the tail itself.",

  teaches: `<p>Everything in Readings 1–2 is calibrated to the bulk of the data — the 'normal' 95% of days. But the days that bankrupt institutions are 1-in-1000 events that barely appear in any sample. EVT is a different statistical philosophy: fit a distribution <strong>only to the extreme observations</strong>, using theorems that say what shape tails must converge to regardless of the parent distribution.</p>
  <p>Two frameworks: <strong>GEV</strong> (block maxima — the worst observation per period) and <strong>POT</strong> (peaks over threshold — every observation beyond a cutoff u, converging to the Generalized Pareto distribution). Both share the crucial tail-index parameter <strong>ξ</strong>. The reading ends with multivariate EVT — joint extremes — and the curse of dimensionality.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Why does this exist? Because the central limit theorem — the justification for normal-based models — is a statement about <em>averages</em>, and risk management's nightmares are <em>maxima</em>. The Fisher-Tippett theorem is the CLT's dark twin: it says sample maxima converge to exactly one family (GEV) no matter the parent distribution. That gives you a principled way to extrapolate beyond the worst thing in your sample — the very thing HS structurally cannot do.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Imagine studying floods. Averaging all daily river levels tells you almost nothing about the once-a-century flood; you'd rather study only the yearly peaks. EVT formalizes this: throw away the unremarkable days, model the extremes directly.</p>
  <p>The single most important object is <strong>ξ (xi), the shape/tail index</strong>: ξ > 0 → Fréchet, heavy power-law tails (t-distribution, Pareto — the realistic case for markets); ξ = 0 → Gumbel, light exponential tails (normal, lognormal); ξ < 0 → Weibull, bounded tails (rare in finance). Practically, FRM narrows the world to 'is ξ positive or zero,' and when in doubt you assume ξ > 0 to be conservative.</p>
  <p>POT's core tension: choose threshold u too high and you have theory-perfect but data-starved estimates; too low and you have plenty of data that isn't genuinely extreme. This bias-variance trade-off IS the exam question.</p>`,

  misconceptions: [

    { wrong: "\"ξ < 0 (Weibull) is a common case to consider for asset returns.\"", right: "Explicitly rare in finance. FRM narrows the real decision to Fréchet (ξ>0) vs Gumbel (ξ=0), with 'assume ξ>0 when in doubt' as the conservative rule." },
    { wrong: "\"To get ES under POT, redo the whole calculation at deeper confidence.\"", right: "ES is a linear function of VaR: ES = VaR/(1−ξ) + (β−ξu)/(1−ξ). Given VaR, ES is one step — recomputing from scratch wastes exam time and signals confusion." },

  recall: [
    { q: "Why is EVT called 'the CLT for maxima'? What theorem plays the CLT's role?", a: "Fisher-Tippett: sample maxima converge in distribution to the GEV family regardless of the parent distribution — the same universality the CLT gives averages, but for extremes." },
    { q: "You're unsure whether ξ is 0 or positive. What do you assume and why?", a: "Assume ξ > 0 (Fréchet). Understating tail risk is the costly error; assuming fat tails is the conservative, model-risk-aware default." },
    { q: "State the two failure modes of threshold choice in POT.", a: "u too high: too few exceedances → imprecise parameter estimates (variance). u too low: exceedances aren't genuinely extreme → GP approximation invalid (bias)." },
    { q: "Given POT VaR = 3.1%, ξ = 0.25, β = 0.75, u = 1%: how do you get ES, and roughly why is it bigger?", a: "ES = VaR/(1−ξ) + (β−ξu)/(1−ξ) = 3.1/0.75 + (0.75−0.25)/0.75 ≈ 4.8%. Bigger because with ξ>0 the tail beyond VaR is fat — the average exceedance sits well past the threshold." },
    { q: "Two markets each have 1-in-250 extreme days. If independent, how often do they have a joint extreme day, and what does this do to estimation?", a: "≈1-in-62,500. Joint extremes are quadratically rarer while the parameters to estimate multiply — the curse of dimensionality that makes multivariate EVT hard and motivates copulas." }

  summary: `<p>EVT fits the tail directly instead of hoping a bulk-fitted model gets it right. <strong>GEV</strong> (Fisher-Tippett): block maxima → 3 params (μ, σ, ξ). <strong>POT</strong> (GPBdH): exceedances over u → Generalized Pareto, 2 params (β, ξ) + threshold choice; more data-efficient. <strong>ξ</strong> is shared and decisive: >0 Fréchet/fat (markets), =0 Gumbel/light, <0 Weibull/bounded (rare in finance); in doubt assume ξ>0. Threshold u: high = accurate-but-starved, low = plentiful-but-biased. POT VaR = u + (β/ξ)[(n/Nᵤ(1−c))^−ξ −1]; ES is linear in VaR. Multivariate: joint extremes are multiplicatively rarer (100×100), covariance tools fail, EV copulas required — the exact blind spot that sank Gaussian-copula CDO models (R9).</p>`
