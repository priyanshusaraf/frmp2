  title: "Empirical Approaches to Risk Metrics and Hedging",
  tagline: "How different points on the interest rate curve move together, and how to hedge one bond position with another when they don't move in perfect lockstep.",

  teaches: `<p>Study Session 2 was about correlation between different assets. This reading turns to a specific, practically important correlation question: yield curve co-movement. You learn why naive DV01-neutral hedging fails, the regression hedge and its adjustment factor β, two-variable regression hedges, level-vs-change regression specifications, and PCA's decomposition of the whole curve into level/slope/curvature.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Bond desks hedge constantly, but different points on the curve (or different instruments — nominal vs real yields) don't move exactly 1-for-1. A naive DV01-neutral hedge silently assumes they do, leaving residual risk nobody priced. This reading is the practical toolkit that motivates the more theoretical term-structure models in Readings 11-15 — it's what a desk does with historical data BEFORE reaching for a full model.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>If yields moved in perfect lockstep, DV01-matching would be a perfect hedge. They don't — a nominal T-bond yield typically moves by MORE than one basis point per basis point move in a real (TIPS) yield. The fix: run a regression of one yield change on the other, and use the SLOPE (β), not 1.0, as your hedge ratio. This also gives you something a naive DV01 hedge never provides: an R² telling you how good the hedge actually is.</p>
  <p>PCA takes this idea to its logical extreme: instead of hedging one yield against one other yield, decompose ALL yield curve movements (30 maturities) into a small number of uncorrelated factors, ranked by variance explained. The first three — level, slope, curvature — usually explain the overwhelming majority of curve variation, letting you hedge the whole curve with just three numbers instead of thirty.</p>`,

    { q: "Why doesn't matching DV01 between a nominal T-bond and a TIPS position guarantee a good hedge?", a: "DV01 matching implicitly assumes nominal and real yields move 1-for-1. Empirically nominal yields move by MORE than one basis point per basis point of real-yield movement, so a naive DV01-neutral hedge leaves residual risk uncaptured by the 1:1 assumption." },
    { q: "What extra information does a regression hedge give you that a naive DV01 hedge never provides?", a: "The regression's R² and standard error — a direct measure of how much of the hedged position's risk the hedge actually explains, i.e., how good the hedge really is." },
    { q: "Why do both level-on-level and change-on-change regression specifications fail to be fully efficient?", a: "In both cases the error terms are serially correlated over time — today's regression residual isn't independent of yesterday's, violating an efficiency (not unbiasedness) condition of OLS." },
    { q: "What does it mean, technically, that PCA's first three components are 'level, slope, and curvature,' and why does this matter practically?", a: "They're the three uncorrelated linear combinations of yield changes that capture the most variance, in order — practically, hedging against just these three factors captures nearly all real yield curve risk instead of needing 30 separate maturity hedges." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The exchange rate between yields", text: "β in a regression hedge is like an exchange rate between two currencies (nominal and real yield) that don't trade 1:1. Naive DV01 hedging assumes a fixed 1:1 exchange rate that doesn't exist." },
    { title: "Level, slope, curvature — the curve's big three", text: "Almost everything the yield curve does can be described by: is it higher or lower overall (level), is it steeper or flatter (slope), or is it more or less bowed (curvature). Three numbers replace thirty maturities." }
  ],

  summary: `<p><strong>DV01-neutral hedging fails</strong> when yields don't move 1:1 (e.g., nominal vs TIPS). <strong>Regression hedge</strong>: β from Δy_hedged on Δy_hedge scales the naive DV01 ratio; gives R²/SE as a hedge-quality readout; β assumed constant is a known limitation — re-estimate across windows. <strong>Two-variable hedges</strong> (e.g., 10Y+30Y for a 20Y) improve R² but aren't crisis-proof. <strong>Level-on-level vs change-on-change</strong>: both unbiased/consistent, both inefficient (serially correlated errors). <strong>PCA</strong>: decomposes the whole curve into uncorrelated factors, no variance lost; first three (level, slope, curvature) explain most curve variation, letting you hedge 30 maturities with 3 numbers.</p>`
