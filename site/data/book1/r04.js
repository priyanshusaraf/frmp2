  title: "Backtesting VaR",
  tagline: "Three readings gave you ways to produce a risk number. This one answers the only question a regulator cares about: how do you know it can be trusted?",

  teaches: `<p>Backtesting compares predicted VaR against realized losses. You learn the vocabulary (<strong>exceptions</strong>, failure rates), the statistics (z-test, <strong>Kupiec unconditional coverage LR test</strong>, Christoffersen conditional coverage), the error taxonomy (Type I vs Type II and who bears each cost), and the regulatory implementation (<strong>Basel traffic-light zones</strong> with capital multipliers).</p>
  <p>This is the reading most likely to appear as a 'which statistic tests what' conceptual question — the map of tests matters more than any single formula.</p>`,

  why: `<p>A VaR model that never gets audited is a story, not a measurement. Banks hold capital as a multiple of VaR — so a bank whose model understates risk holds too little capital while looking compliant. Basel's answer: count the days actual losses exceeded 99% VaR over 250 days; more than 4 and the capital multiplier starts rising. The statistics exist because randomness is noisy: even a perfect model produces bad-luck exception streaks, and even a broken model can get lucky. The tests separate luck from defect — imperfectly, which is exactly what the Type I/II framework quantifies.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Your VaR model is a weather forecaster claiming '5% chance of a storm-level loss each day.' Over 252 days you expect ≈12.6 storms. If you observe 22, is the forecaster broken or unlucky? That's a coin-flip question in disguise — a binomial test on the exception count. The z-statistic and Kupiec LR are two dress codes for the same binomial logic.</p>
  <p>But counting storms isn't enough. Twelve storms scattered randomly is consistent with a good model; twelve storms in one month means the model failed to adapt when the climate shifted — even though the COUNT looks fine. That's why conditional coverage (independence of exceptions over time) exists as a separate test.</p>`,

  recall: [

    { q: "Why do regulators accept a 10.8% false-alarm rate on good models?", a: "Because the alternative — loosening the trigger — raises Type II risk: flawed models slipping through with too little capital behind them. Regulators price systemic misses as costlier than unfair penalties." },
    { q: "A model shows exactly the expected number of exceptions, but all in one quarter. Which tests pass and fail, and what does it mean?", a: "Kupiec (count) passes; independence (LRind) fails, so conditional coverage fails. The model didn't adapt to a regime shift — the count is fine, the timing is damning." },

    { q: "Why does Basel mandate 99% VaR rather than letting banks choose?", a: "Capital at 99% ≈ 1.24× capital at 97.5% — banks would game the confidence level down to save capital. Mandating removes the dial." }

  summary: `<p>Backtesting audits VaR by counting <strong>exceptions</strong> (loss > VaR). Binomial logic → <strong>z-test</strong>: z=(x−pT)/√(p(1−p)T) vs 1.96. <strong>Kupiec LRuc</strong> (χ²(1), reject >3.84) tests the count; <strong>Christoffersen</strong> adds independence — LRcc = LRuc + LRind, reject >5.99; clustering fails independence even when the count passes. <strong>Type I</strong> (punish good model) vs <strong>Type II</strong> (miss bad model — regulators' bigger fear). <strong>Basel</strong>: 250 days, 99% VaR: green 0–4 (k=3.00), yellow 5–9 (k=3.40–3.85, four named causes, 'small sample' is a distractor), red 10+ (k=4.00). Dirty-P&L problem: static-portfolio VaR vs traded-portfolio reality → use cleaned/hypothetical returns. Two confidence levels (VaR's and the test's) are separate dials.</p>`
