  title: "Non-Parametric Approaches",
  tagline: "Historical simulation, upgraded: keep the 'let the data speak' philosophy but stop treating a 3-year-old observation like yesterday's news.",

  teaches: `<p>Reading 1 left you with two extremes: assume nothing (historical simulation) or assume everything (a full parametric distribution). This reading builds the middle ground — four upgrades that keep HS's assumption-free character while fixing its two structural flaws: (1) every observation in the window gets equal weight regardless of age or regime, and (2) you can only read VaR at confidence levels your data happens to support.</p>
  <p>You learn <strong>bootstrapping</strong> (precision through resampling), <strong>density smoothing</strong> (VaR at any confidence level), and the four <strong>weighting schemes</strong>: age-weighted, volatility-weighted, correlation-weighted, and filtered historical simulation.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Plain HS has a failure mode called the <strong>ghost effect</strong>: a single crash day dominates VaR for exactly n days, then vanishes overnight the moment it rolls out of the window — even though nothing changed in the market that day. Risk numbers that jump for administrative reasons destroy credibility with traders and regulators alike. The weighting schemes exist to make HS's memory fade gradually and to make its inputs reflect today's volatility regime, not an average of stale ones.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Think of your historical window as a committee voting on today's risk. Plain HS gives every member an equal vote — including the member who joined 4 years ago in a different regime — then expels members abruptly on their n-th day. The fixes are all re-weightings of the committee:</p>
  <p><strong>Age-weighting</strong>: recent members get louder votes, fading geometrically (λ). <strong>Volatility-weighting</strong>: every member's testimony is restated in today's units — 'that return happened when vol was 2×, so scale it down.' <strong>Correlation-weighting</strong>: same restatement, applied to how assets co-move, not just how much each moves. <strong>Filtered HS</strong>: the full treatment — strip each return down to its standardized shock, bootstrap the shocks, re-dress them in today's (GARCH-forecast) volatility. Only FHS can generate losses worse than anything in the historical record, because recombined shocks can land in configurations history never produced.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "What exactly is a ghost effect, and which fix addresses it?", a: "A large observation dominates VaR for exactly n days, then drops out of the window overnight with no market cause — VaR jumps for administrative reasons. Age-weighting fixes it: weights fade geometrically instead of falling off a cliff." },
    { q: "Set λ = 0.999 with n = 250. What does your age-weighted VaR approximately equal?", a: "Nearly plain equal-weighted HS — as λ→1 the geometric weights flatten toward 1/n." },
    { q: "Current vol forecast is 12%; a −4% return occurred when vol was 30%. What return enters vol-weighted HS?", a: "−4% × (12/30) = −1.6%. Then ordinary HS runs on adjusted returns." },
    { q: "Why can FHS produce losses beyond the historical maximum while plain HS cannot?", a: "Plain HS can only replay observed returns. FHS bootstraps standardized residuals and rescales them by current conditional vol — shocks recombine into configurations never observed, including worse ones." },
    { q: "Your window covers only the calm 2017-2019 period. What sign of error should you expect in plain HS VaR, and why doesn't bootstrapping help?", a: "Understated VaR — the window lacks stress observations. Bootstrapping resamples the same calm data; it reduces variance, not window bias." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The committee", text: "Plain HS: equal votes, abrupt expulsions. Age-weighting: seniority in reverse. Vol-weighting: testimony translated into today's units. Correlation-weighting: the committee's group dynamics restated. FHS: dissolve the committee into pure shocks and re-poll." },
    { title: "Ghost story", text: "A crash observation haunts your VaR for exactly n days, then vanishes at midnight — that's the 'ghost effect.' Age weights are the exorcism: spirits fade gradually instead of disappearing on schedule." },

  ],

  summary: `<p>Plain HS has two flaws: equal weights (→ ghost effects, regime blindness) and discrete confidence levels. Fixes: <strong>bootstrap</strong> (precision by resampling), <strong>density smoothing</strong> (any confidence level), <strong>age-weighted</strong> w(i)=λ^(i−1)(1−λ)/(1−λⁿ) (fading memory; λ→1 = plain HS), <strong>volatility-weighted</strong> r* = (σ_now/σ_then)r (data adjusted, method unchanged), <strong>correlation-weighted</strong> (full covariance matrix updated — strictly broader), and <strong>FHS</strong> (GARCH-standardize → bootstrap → rescale; captures clustering; can exceed historical max loss). Non-parametric strengths: no distribution assumption, skew/fat-tails handled naturally. Weaknesses: hostage to the window — quiet window understates, wild window overstates.</p>`
