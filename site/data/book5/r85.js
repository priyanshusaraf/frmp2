  title: "Portfolio Risk: Analytical Methods",
  tagline: "Decomposing portfolio risk into marginal, incremental, and component VaR — the toolkit for actually managing (not just measuring) a multi-position portfolio's risk.",

  teaches: `<p>Diversified vs undiversified vs individual VaR, the role of correlation (uncorrelated and perfectly-correlated bounds), marginal VaR, incremental VaR (and its shortcut approximation), component VaR, using marginal VaR to find the risk-minimizing portfolio, and the excess-return-to-marginal-VaR ratio for finding the OPTIMAL (not just minimum-risk) portfolio.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This is Book 1's VaR machinery (R1, R5) applied to the specific job of managing a live multi-asset portfolio: which position should I trim, which should I add to, and where's the genuinely optimal (not just lowest-risk) allocation?</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Correlation sets the BOUNDS on portfolio VaR: ρ=0 gives the lower bound (VaR_P=√(VaR₁²+VaR₂²)), ρ=1 gives the upper bound (VaR_P=VaR₁+VaR₂, the "undiversified" case). Everything in between reflects partial diversification benefit.</p>
  <p>MARGINAL VaR is the per-unit-change sensitivity (∂VaR_P/∂position) — conveniently expressed as (VaR_P/portfolio value)×β_i. INCREMENTAL VaR is the ACTUAL change in VaR from adding a whole new position — in principle needs full portfolio revaluation (expensive, especially with hundreds of positions), but can be approximated cheaply using the marginal VaR shortcut for SMALL additions. COMPONENT VaR (=MVaR_i × dollar weight = VaR_P×β_i×w_i) answers "how much would total VaR fall if I removed this position entirely" — and component VaRs SUM EXACTLY to total portfolio VaR, a clean decomposition.</p>
  <p>The critical distinction for portfolio MANAGEMENT (not just risk measurement): setting all marginal VaRs EQUAL gives you the MINIMUM-VARIANCE portfolio — but that's not the OPTIMAL portfolio. The optimal portfolio equates the EXCESS-RETURN-TO-MARGINAL-VAR ratio across all positions (the VaR-based analogue of the Sharpe ratio's tangency condition) — a portfolio can have the lowest possible risk and still leave return on the table.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "Two uncorrelated positions have VaR₁=$10 million and VaR₂=$20 million. What is portfolio VaR?", a: "VaR_P = √(10²+20²) = √500 ≈ $22.36 million." },
    { q: "A manager notices Position A's marginal VaR is much lower than Position B's, and shifts capital from B to A until the two marginal VaRs are equal. Has the manager found the optimal portfolio?", a: "No — equalizing marginal VaRs finds the MINIMUM-VARIANCE portfolio, not necessarily the optimal one. To find the truly optimal portfolio, the manager needs to equate each position's EXCESS-RETURN-TO-MARGINAL-VAR ratio, not just its marginal VaR alone. A position could have a low marginal VaR but also a low expected excess return, making it a poor allocation choice on a risk-adjusted basis despite its small marginal VaR." },
    { q: "Why is incremental VaR generally more expensive to compute accurately than marginal VaR, and when is the marginal VaR shortcut most appropriate?", a: "Precise incremental VaR requires FULL REVALUATION of the entire portfolio after adding the new position — remeasuring not just the new position's own risk but how it changes the risk contribution of every existing position (via the covariance matrix). This is expensive for portfolios with many positions. The marginal VaR shortcut (using the new position's risk-factor vector dotted with the portfolio's existing marginal VaR vector) is much cheaper and reasonably accurate for SMALL additions to the portfolio, where nonlinear effects are minimal." },
    { q: "A portfolio has Position X (excess return 9%, MVaR 0.06) and Position Y (excess return 12%, MVaR 0.075). Which position's allocation should increase to move toward the optimal portfolio?", a: "Compute the ratios: X = 0.09/0.06 = 1.5; Y = 0.12/0.075 = 1.6. Since Y's ratio is higher, the portfolio should increase its allocation to Y (and/or decrease X) to move toward the point where both ratios are equal — the optimal portfolio condition." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Individual VaR</strong>=Z×σ×|w|×P. <strong>Bounds</strong>: uncorrelated VaR_P=√(ΣVaRᵢ²) (lower); perfectly correlated=ΣVaRᵢ (upper, "undiversified"). <strong>Marginal VaR</strong>=(VaR_P/portfolio value)×βᵢ — the per-unit sensitivity. <strong>Incremental VaR</strong>=actual change from a new position (needs full revaluation for precision; MVaR-based dot-product shortcut for small additions). <strong>Component VaR</strong>=MVaRᵢ×(wᵢ×P)=VaR_P×βᵢ×wᵢ — sums EXACTLY to total portfolio VaR. <strong>Risk-minimizing</strong> portfolio: equal marginal VaRs (MVaRᵢ=MVaRⱼ). <strong>Optimal</strong> portfolio: equal excess-return-to-marginal-VaR ratios — a DIFFERENT, more valuable condition than simply minimizing risk. Non-elliptical distributions: use historical-return sorting to estimate component VaR instead of the beta-based formula.</p>`
