  title: "Factors",
  tagline: "The named, tradeable factors: value, size, momentum, and the macro factors (growth, inflation, volatility) — with rational and behavioral stories for each.",

  teaches: `<p>Value investing and the book-to-market ratio, macroeconomic factors (economic growth, inflation, volatility) and how they drive returns, managing volatility risk, the Fama-French three-factor model, and value vs. momentum investing strategies (including the disappearing size premium).</p>`,

  why: `<p>These are the concrete, tradeable versions of R81's abstract factor theory. Understanding which factors are genuinely persistent (value, momentum) vs. which disappeared after discovery (size) — and why — is central to evaluating any factor-based investment claim.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Value stocks (high book-to-market) have significantly outperformed growth stocks (low book-to-market) for 50+ years — with two competing explanations. RATIONAL: value firms have high, ASYMMETRIC adjustment costs (fixed assets, can't redeploy capital when times change) making them fundamentally riskier — the premium compensates for this. BEHAVIORAL: investors OVEREXTRAPOLATE growth stocks' past growth into the future (bidding growth stocks up too high) while being LOSS-AVERSE about value stocks' past poor performance (bidding them down too low) — value stocks are simply cheap, not riskier.</p>
  <p>The SIZE effect (small stocks outperform large, after beta-adjustment) DISAPPEARED after its discovery (Banz/Reinganum 1981) — two explanations: data mining (the original finding was an in-sample fluke) or investor action (rational investors bid up small-cap prices until the anomaly vanished, consistent with EMH). Momentum (buy past winners, short past losers) vastly outperforms value and size — but is PRONE TO CRASHES, because momentum is a positive-feedback (destabilizing) strategy, while value is a negative-feedback (stabilizing) strategy.</p>`,

      pitfall: "Rational explanation: value firms have high, ASYMMETRIC adjustment costs (fixed, non-redeployable capital) making them fundamentally riskier — the value premium is compensation for losses in 'bad times' specifically defined by labor income risk, investment growth, luxury consumption, long-run consumption risk, housing risk. Behavioral explanation: overextrapolation (investors assume past growth continues, bidding growth stocks too high) + loss aversion/mental accounting (investors view value stocks' past poor performance as risky, bidding them too low) — value stocks are simply CHEAP, not objectively riskier.",

      example: "Recessions: government/IG bonds outperform (~12.3-12.6%), equities/high-yield underperform. Expansions: equities outperform (large stocks 12.4%, small stocks 16.8%). High-yield bonds are relatively INDIFFERENT to the growth cycle (7.4% recession vs 7.7% expansion). High inflation hurts BOTH stocks and bonds; volatility (VIX) is negatively correlated with stock returns (~−0.39) via the LEVERAGE EFFECT (falling equity value + stable debt → higher leverage → riskier equity → lower prices) plus a discount-rate channel (CAPM: higher vol → higher required return → lower current price).",

      pitfall: "Volatility has a NEGATIVE risk premium — unlike most assets, where a long position earns a positive expected return, collecting the volatility premium requires SELLING volatility (selling puts). Realized volatility is lower on average than VIX-implied volatility by ~2-3%, meaning options are 'expensive' on average and volatility sellers profit — until a crash, when losses can be catastrophic (the volatility index fell ~70% Sept-Nov 2008; full-sample skewness −8.26 vs. −0.37 excluding the crisis).",

In Fama-French, HML and SMB betas are CENTERED ON ZERO — the average investor (holding the market with no size/value tilt) earns just the market return; investors must specifically CHOOSE a value or size tilt to capture those premiums.",

      pitfall: "Small stocks DO still tend to have somewhat higher returns (a 'weak' size effect), partly due to lower liquidity — but the RISK-ADJUSTED excess return over the market is no longer present. Don't confuse 'weak residual size effect' with 'the SMB premium is alive and well.'",

It's a viable strategy only for investors who can tolerate rare, severe losses." },
    { wrong: "\"The small-cap size premium remains a robust, exploitable anomaly today.\"", right: "The size premium effectively DISAPPEARED after its discovery (Banz/Reinganum, 1981) — either due to data mining in the original study or investors arbitraging it away, consistent with EMH. Small stocks show only a weak residual return premium, largely attributable to illiquidity, not a robust risk-adjusted anomaly." },
    { wrong: "\"Momentum and value are simply opposite strategies (a negative correlation close to -1).\"", right: "Their return correlation is only about −0.16 — they're stabilizing vs. destabilizing in FEEDBACK MECHANISM, but not simply mirror-image return streams." }

  recall: [
    { q: "Explain the two competing explanations for why the value premium exists, and how they differ in their view of value stocks' underlying riskiness.", a: "Rational explanation: value stocks are genuinely riskier because value firms have high, asymmetric adjustment costs (fixed capital that can't be redeployed when conditions change) — the premium is fair compensation for bearing this real risk in bad times. Behavioral explanation: value stocks are NOT objectively riskier — investors simply overextrapolate growth stocks' past growth (bidding them up too high) while being loss-averse about value stocks' past poor performance (bidding them down too low), making value stocks cheap relative to fundamentals rather than genuinely risky." },
    { q: "Why did the small-cap size premium disappear after its discovery by Banz and Reinganum, while the value premium has persisted for over 50 years?", a: "Two explanations for the size premium's disappearance: it may have been a data-mined, in-sample artifact not borne out in subsequent out-of-sample data (Fischer Black's hypothesis), or rational investors, once alerted to the anomaly, may have bid up small-cap prices until the excess return was arbitraged away (consistent with EMH). The value premium's persistence despite being equally well-known suggests either a genuine, non-arbitrageable risk compensation (rational story) or persistent behavioral biases and structural barriers to arbitrage capital that haven't been overcome (behavioral story) — the key empirical contrast is that one anomaly vanished on discovery and the other didn't." },
    { q: "Why is momentum investing described as a 'positive feedback' strategy, and why does this make it prone to crashes in a way value investing is not?", a: "Momentum buys stocks that have already risen and shorts stocks that have already fallen — as more momentum investors pile into rising stocks, prices rise further, attracting even more buyers (positive feedback, destabilizing). This creates fragility: when a shock (like a government bailout propping up momentum's shorted 'losers') interrupts the trend, momentum positions unwind violently, causing crashes. Value investing does the opposite — it buys stocks that have fallen (once cheap enough), providing a stabilizing, negative-feedback force that dampens rather than amplifies price swings." },
    { q: "Why can selling volatility (e.g., writing out-of-the-money put options) generate steady profits for years and then produce catastrophic losses?", a: "Volatility carries a negative risk premium — realized volatility is on average lower than VIX-implied volatility (by roughly 2-3%), meaning option sellers collect a persistent premium in normal times, similar to collecting insurance premiums. But during a genuine crisis (like 2007-09), volatility spikes dramatically, and sellers face the 'insurance payout' side of the trade — losses that can be severe and sudden (the volatility index fell nearly 70% in a few months), unlike the steady gains accumulated beforehand." }

    { title: "Rational riskier vs. behaviorally cheap", text: "Two stories, same value premium: 'value stocks are genuinely dangerous' (rational) vs. 'value stocks are just misunderstood and underpriced' (behavioral) — same outperformance, completely different implied risk." },
    { title: "Stabilizer vs. accelerant", text: "Value is a shock absorber — it buys the dip and helps prices recover. Momentum is gasoline on a fire — it buys the rally and helps prices run further, right up until the fire burns out and momentum investors get burned with it." },

  summary: `<p><strong>Value premium</strong>: high book-to-market outperforms low — rational (asymmetric adjustment costs, genuine risk) vs. behavioral (overextrapolation of growth + loss aversion on value, mispricing) explanations. <strong>Macro factors</strong>: growth/inflation/volatility — SHOCKS matter, not levels; high-yield bonds are growth-cycle-indifferent; volatility's leverage effect + discount-rate channel both lower stock returns. <strong>Volatility</strong>: negative risk premium — sell options to collect it, but tail risk is severe (insurance-selling analogy). <strong>Fama-French</strong>: MKT+SMB+HML, SMB/HML betas centered on ZERO (active tilt required). <strong>Size premium</strong> disappeared post-discovery (data mining or arbitraged away); <strong>value</strong> persisted. <strong>Momentum</strong> (WML/UMD): vastly outperforms but crash-prone — positive feedback/destabilizing, vs. value's negative feedback/stabilizing character.</p>`
