  title: "Portfolio Construction",
  tagline: "From signals to positions: refining alphas as an alternative to hard constraints, neutralization, transaction costs and the no-trade region, and four construction techniques from screens to quadratic programming.",

  teaches: `<p>Portfolio construction inputs, refining alphas (scaling, trimming) as an alternative to constrained optimization, neutralization (benchmark, cash, risk-factor), transaction cost implications, practical issues (risk aversion calibration, alpha coverage), the no-trade region, four construction techniques (screens/stratification/linear/quadratic programming), and portfolio return dispersion.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Alphas are noisy forecasts, not gospel — this reading shows how practitioners actually turn a raw alpha forecast into real, tradeable, constraint-respecting positions without simply bolting constraints onto an already-fragile optimization.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Rather than solving a constrained optimization directly (which gets messy fast as constraints pile up), you can REFINE THE ALPHAS THEMSELVES so that an UNCONSTRAINED optimization naturally produces the constrained result. For a no-short-selling account, you solve backward for the alphas that would make unconstrained optimal weights nonnegative — same outcome, cleaner mechanics, and it isolates exactly how much a specific constraint costs you (via the resulting drop in effective information coefficient).</p>
  <p>Transaction costs create a genuine NO-TRADE REGION: a range of alpha values too small to justify the cost of rebalancing. Bigger risk aversion, higher marginal contribution to active risk, or higher transaction costs all WIDEN this no-trade zone — sometimes the mathematically "optimal" trade simply isn't worth executing.</p>
  <p>Four construction techniques trade sophistication for estimation-error risk: screens (simplest, rank and cut) → stratification (match benchmark's size/sector weights, loses within-category alpha info) → linear programming (match more risk characteristics without needing mutually exclusive buckets) → quadratic programming (theoretically best, uses alpha+risk+transaction costs jointly, but HIGHLY sensitive to covariance estimation error — a 5% estimation error can make value-added actually NEGATIVE).</p>`,

Scaling: compare the SD (scale) of refined (constrained) alphas to unconstrained alphas to quantify the IC decrease caused by a constraint, then rescale if needed. Trimming: reduce extreme alpha values (threshold often 3× the alpha scale) — examine large alphas for questionable data (set those to zero) and cap remaining large values at some multiple of scale.",

      name: "Neutralization",

Benchmark neutralization: match active portfolio beta to benchmark beta (eliminates an unintended market-timing bet) — equivalent to a beta constraint in mean-variance optimization.

      def: "Active risk aversion is hard to intuit directly, but managers CAN intuit their target information ratio and desired active risk level — risk aversion = IR/(2×desired active risk%). Aversion to SPECIFIC factor risk serves two purposes: (1) limits exposure to positions with large potential losses (e.g., mismatched sector risk), (2) reduces DISPERSION across multiple client portfolios by making them hold more similar assets.",
      example: "Alpha coverage: for manager forecasts on stocks NOT in the benchmark, assign benchmark weight zero (but a nonzero ACTIVE weight is fine). For benchmark stocks WITHOUT a manager forecast, infer an adjusted (typically nonzero) alpha from stocks that DO have forecasts, rather than leaving it undefined.",

      pitfall: "The no-trade region WIDENS with: higher risk aversion, higher marginal contribution to active risk, and higher transaction costs. Underestimating transaction costs leads to trading TOO FREQUENTLY, and short horizons make alpha estimates too uncertain to justify trading on them.",

Stratification: divide into mutually exclusive size/sector categories first, match benchmark category weights — good risk control IF categories capture the benchmark's real risk dimensions, but LOSES within-category and cross-sector alpha information. Linear programming: matches MULTIPLE risk characteristics (size, volatility, sector, beta) without requiring mutually exclusive categories, can include transaction costs and position limits — closely resembles the benchmark but can differ sharply in NUMBER of assets held or in un-modeled risk dimensions. Quadratic programming: jointly incorporates alphas, risks, AND transaction costs with any number of constraints — theoretically the BEST method.",

    { wrong: "\"A stock in the benchmark without an alpha forecast should simply be assigned an alpha of zero.\"", right: "An adjusted, typically NONZERO alpha should be INFERRED from stocks that DO have forecasts (via the benchmark-neutral adjustment process) — assigning a flat zero ignores useful information embedded in the covariance structure with forecasted stocks." },

  recall: [
    { q: "A manager's active portfolio has a beta of 1.15 while the benchmark's beta is 1.0. This wasn't an intentional bet. What adjustment should be made, and what is this process called?", a: "Benchmark neutralization — the alphas should be adjusted so the active portfolio's beta matches the benchmark's beta (1.0), removing the unintended active bet on market direction. This is equivalent to imposing a beta constraint directly in a mean-variance optimization, but achieved by adjusting the alpha inputs instead." },
    { q: "Why does the reading emphasize that transaction costs 'occur at a point in time' while benefits 'occur over time,' and why does this complicate portfolio rebalancing decisions?", a: "A trade's cost is paid immediately (a spread or commission at execution), but the resulting alpha benefit accrues gradually over the holding period. This creates ambiguity about the correct time horizon over which to amortize the cost — a short expected holding period makes the same transaction cost proportionally much more expensive (annualized) than a long one, so the manager must estimate holding periods carefully before deciding whether a trade clears the cost hurdle." },
    { q: "A 400-stock quadratic programming optimization requires estimating 79,800 covariances. Why might even a well-designed quadratic program underperform a simpler technique like stratification in practice?", a: "Quadratic programming's theoretical superiority depends on having ACCURATE covariance estimates — but with moderate estimation error (e.g., 5%), the value added by exploiting this (mis-estimated) covariance structure can actually turn NEGATIVE. Simpler techniques like stratification use much less granular information and are correspondingly less exposed to this estimation-error risk, even though they sacrifice some theoretical optimality." },
    { q: "Why might two clients of the same manager end up holding meaningfully different portfolio weights (e.g., 60/40 vs. 62/38 stocks/bonds) even though the manager has the same alpha views for both?", a: "If an existing client's portfolio is currently 60/40 and the new optimal weight is 62/38, rebalancing the EXISTING account may not be worth the transaction cost (a no-trade region applies). A NEW client, however, can be set directly to the new optimal 62/38 weights without incurring any rebalancing cost, since there's no legacy position to unwind — creating rational dispersion between the two accounts that reflects transaction-cost economics, not an error." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Inputs</strong>: current portfolio (most certain), alphas, covariances, transaction costs, active risk aversion. <strong>Refining alphas</strong> (scaling, trimming) is an alternative to direct constrained optimization — solves backward for alphas producing the constrained result. <strong>Neutralization</strong>: benchmark (match beta), cash, risk-factor — modified α = α_position−(α_benchmark×β_position). <strong>Transaction costs</strong>: point-in-time cost vs. over-time benefit complicates amortization; create the <strong>no-trade region</strong> (widens with risk aversion, marginal active-risk contribution, transaction costs). <strong>Risk aversion</strong> = IR/(2×desired active risk%). <strong>Alpha coverage</strong>: non-benchmark stocks with forecasts get zero benchmark weight but nonzero active weight; benchmark stocks without forecasts get an INFERRED (nonzero) alpha. <strong>Four techniques</strong>: screens (simplest) → stratification (category-matched, loses info) → linear programming (multi-characteristic) → quadratic programming (theoretically best, fragile to covariance estimation error — 5% error can flip value-added negative). <strong>Dispersion</strong> across client accounts is economically OPTIMAL given transaction costs, not inherently a flaw.</p>`
