  title: "Hedge Funds",
  tagline: "Strategies, database biases, alpha-beta separation, and what hedge fund returns really contain — plus why diversification across strategies fails exactly when you need it most.",

  teaches: `<p>Hedge fund characteristics vs. mutual funds; database biases and industry evolution (1994 Fed shock, LTCM 1998, dot-com 2001); institutional investor impact; alpha-beta separation; the named hedge fund strategies and their risk characteristics; historical performance analysis; convergence of risk factors during stress; and risk-sharing asymmetry between managers and investors.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Hedge fund returns are often misunderstood as pure "alpha" when much of it is disguised beta exposure or compensation for specific, named tail risks (deal risk, credit risk, liquidity risk). This reading teaches you to decompose hedge fund returns into their actual risk-factor content rather than taking "hedge fund alpha" at face value.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Hedge funds differ from mutual funds in being private, unregulated, highly leveraged, and taking both long AND short positions — with a fee structure (management fee + 10-20% of profits) that creates a genuine principal-agent conflict: managers are incentivized to take outsized risk (upside is shared, but a blown-up fund can simply be restarted under a new name), which investors can partially counter by preferring managers with significant personal capital in the fund.</p>
  <p>The most important structural lesson: hedge fund strategies that LOOK diversified in normal times CONVERGE in risk during genuine market-wide stress (1994 Fed shock, 1998 LTCM, 2007-08 crisis) — nearly all strategies lost money simultaneously in each event, EXCEPT short sellers and (usually) managed futures. Diversifying across hedge fund STRATEGIES doesn't protect you from a genuine systemic funding crisis, because the common thread — leverage and forced liquidation — hits everyone at once.</p>
  <p>ALPHA-BETA SEPARATION is the key analytical tool: identify how much return comes from bearing systematic risk (beta) vs. genuine active skill (alpha), then actively manage them independently (e.g., hedge out unwanted beta via futures while pursuing alpha) — separating alpha and beta lets a manager target a SPECIFIC beta (e.g., 1.0 to a benchmark) while independently optimizing for alpha.</p>`,

Dot-com collapse (2000-01): hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 with HALF its volatility, triggering a wave of institutional capital inflow.",

      pitfall: "Institutional investors accepted a MUCH HIGHER fee environment for access — with institutional scrutiny came greater demands for operational integrity and governance. There is genuine CONCERN that no identifiable alpha exists in aggregate hedge fund investing, making manager differentiation increasingly important.",

DISTINGUISHING alpha from beta means identifying how much of a return comes from each; SEPARATING alpha from beta means actively managing them independently (e.g., hedging out unwanted systematic risk via derivatives while pursuing alpha).",
      example: "A manager benchmarked to the S&P 500 pursues alpha opportunities that create unwanted beta exposure — he uses futures to hedge all systematic risk EXCEPT S&P 500 exposure, forcing portfolio beta to exactly 1.0 relative to the benchmark, while independently optimizing for alpha.",

Merger (risk) arbitrage: captures M&A spreads; primary risk = DEAL RISK (deal fails to close); largest negative returns follow large S&P declines (mergers more likely called off in a downturn — 'long deal risk'). Distressed securities: invests across the capital structure of financially/operationally distressed firms, LONG bias, exposed to low-credit-rating corporate risk (proxy: high-yield bonds, ρ≈0.55 with the DJCS Distressed index). Fixed-income arbitrage: exploits pricing anomalies between related fixed-income securities (swap spread, yield-curve spread, mortgage spread, fixed-income volatility, capital structure/credit arbitrage trades). Convertible arbitrage: long convertible bonds, short the underlying stock at a delta-neutral ratio; return = liquidity premium paid by issuers for holding/hedging the convertible. Long/short equity (30-40% of hedge funds): both long and short equity positions, highly IDIOSYNCRATIC manager-dependent performance; directional market exposure PLUS long-small/short-large exposure. Dedicated short bias: net short equities, negatively correlated with equities. Emerging markets: LONG bias (shorting is harder in emerging markets). Equity market neutral: targets ZERO beta(s) against equity indices; no single common risk factor across different equity-market-neutral funds' strategies.",

      example: "A later top-50-large-hedge-fund study (2002-2010): the 'lower/upper bound' portfolio (rebalanced yearly, no foresight) showed NO significant alpha; the 'foresight-assisted' portfolio (selected using 2010 year-end data) showed a statistically significant 0.53%/month alpha. Both top-50 portfolio versions showed SIGNIFICANT alpha relative to broad hedge fund INDICES (DJCSI, HFRI) — buying LARGE hedge funds beats just buying the index.",

August 1998 (pre-LTCM collapse): 8 of 10 sub-indices had large losses (short sellers, managed futures again spared) — driven by market-wide liquidation of risky assets amplified by LTCM's own high leverage. August 2007 and July-October 2008: ALL (or nearly all) specialist style sub-indices lost money simultaneously — only short sellers were consistently positive.",
      pitfall: "The common driver across ALL these convergence events: leverage magnifies both gains and losses, and a market-wide FUNDING crisis makes diversification across strategies fail, because forced liquidation of leveraged positions hits every strategy at once.

  recall: [
    { q: "During the 2007-08 financial crisis, nearly all hedge fund strategy sub-indices lost money simultaneously, despite representing supposedly diversified strategies. Why did diversification fail here?", a: "A market-wide funding crisis creates a common driver across virtually all leveraged strategies: forced liquidation of positions as funding disappears. Since most hedge fund strategies rely on leverage to generate returns, when a systemic funding crisis hits, ALL leveraged strategies face simultaneous margin calls and forced deleveraging — the risk factors that seemed diversified in normal times CONVERGE because the underlying vulnerability (dependence on continued leverage/funding availability) was shared all along, just not visible until the crisis exposed it." },
    { q: "Why does merger arbitrage show its largest negative returns specifically following large negative S&P 500 returns, rather than during calm markets?", a: "Merger arbitrage's primary risk is DEAL RISK — the risk that an announced merger fails to close. When the broader market experiences a large decline, pending mergers are more likely to be called off (financing dries up, strategic rationale weakens, or acquirer confidence drops) — this makes merger arbitrage effectively 'long deal risk,' meaning it's exposed to a correlated failure mode precisely when equity markets are already stressed." },
    { q: "A hedge fund manager wants to pursue an alpha-generating strategy that happens to create unwanted exposure to interest rate and currency risk beyond the fund's intended beta target. How can the manager address this while still pursuing the strategy?", a: "This is 'separating alpha and beta' — the manager can use derivatives (e.g., futures or swaps) to hedge out the UNWANTED systematic exposures (interest rate, currency risk) while retaining the specific alpha-generating position, effectively isolating and preserving the alpha bet while independently controlling the fund's overall beta profile to match its target." },
    { q: "Why might an institutional investor specifically seek out hedge fund managers who have a significant portion of their own personal wealth invested in the fund?", a: "This addresses the risk-sharing asymmetry (principal-agent problem) inherent in typical hedge fund fee structures — managers earning 15-20% of profits above a high-water mark have an incentive to take outsized risks, since they share in the upside but a failed fund's downside mostly falls on outside investors (and the manager can often start a new fund afterward). A manager with substantial personal capital at stake bears real downside risk alongside investors, better aligning incentives." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Hedge funds</strong>: private, unregulated, leveraged, long+short, fee=mgmt+10-20% profits; selection bias in databases is empirically SMALL. <strong>Evolution</strong>: 1994 Fed shock (databases emerge) → 1998 LTCM (leverage's dark side) → 2001 dot-com (institutional inflow triggered by strong risk-adjusted performance). <strong>Alpha-beta separation</strong>: distinguish (diagnose skill vs risk) vs. separate (actively hedge unwanted beta while pursuing alpha). <strong>Strategies</strong>: managed futures/global macro (trend-following, asset allocation, low equity correlation, benefits from extremes); merger arb (deal risk, hurt by market declines); distressed (long credit risk, high-yield bond proxy); fixed-income arb (yield-curve/swap-spread/mortgage/vol trades); convertible arb (liquidity premium); long/short equity (idiosyncratic); dedicated short bias; emerging markets (long-biased); equity market neutral (zero beta target). <strong>Performance</strong>: large hedge funds show declining but still-positive alpha over time (more competition); big funds beat hedge fund INDICES. <strong>Convergence</strong>: strategies diversify in normal times, CONVERGE during systemic funding crises (1994, 1998, 2007-08) — managed futures' convex profile is a partial hedge. <strong>Risk-sharing asymmetry</strong>: incentive fees encourage outsized risk-taking — prefer managers with real personal capital at stake.</p>`
