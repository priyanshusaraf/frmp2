  title: "Factor Theory",
  tagline: "It is not exposure to an asset that is rewarded — it is exposure to the underlying factors. Assets are bundles of factor risks, and factor risk premiums pay you for bearing losses in bad times.",

  teaches: `<p>Factor theory's three principles, the CAPM (assumptions, six implications, seven shortcomings), multifactor models, the stochastic discount factor (pricing kernel), and efficient market theory.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This reading reframes everything: risk premiums aren't rewards for holding specific assets, they're compensation for exposure to underlying FACTOR risks — exposures to "bad times." This lens reframes every later Book 5 reading: factors (R82), alpha (R83), portfolio construction (R84), and even performance evaluation (R88) all build on "what factor exposure am I actually being paid for?"</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Three principles anchor factor theory: (1) factors are important, not assets — look through the asset to its underlying risk factor exposures; (2) assets represent bundles of factors — a corporate bond bundles equity risk, interest rate risk, volatility risk, default risk; (3) investors have differing optimal risk exposures — different investors want different exposures to the same factors (e.g., volatility) based on how well they personally can withstand bad times.</p>
  <p>The CAPM is the simplest possible factor model: ONE factor (the market), priced via beta. Its six lessons: hold the factor not the asset, investors have differing optimal exposures, the average investor holds 100% of the market, factor risk exposure must be rewarded, risk is measured as beta, and valuable assets (positive payoff in bad times) have LOW risk premiums. But CAPM rests on seven unrealistic assumptions (financial-wealth-only, mean-variance utility, single-period horizon, homogeneous expectations, frictionless markets, price-taking, free information) — multifactor models relax the single-factor assumption, and the stochastic discount factor (SDF/pricing kernel) generalizes further by allowing nonlinear "bad times" indexing across many factors simultaneously.</p>`,

(3) Investors have differing optimal risk exposures — e.g., to volatility, based on how well they can personally withstand bad times.",

(4) Exposure to factor risk must be rewarded — the market risk premium via the capital market line (CML). (5) Risk is measured as beta exposure — higher beta = higher required return. (6) Valuable assets (positive payoff in bad times) have LOW risk premiums.",
      example: "During the 2007-09 crisis, safe havens (gold, government bonds) became so attractive some had NEGATIVE expected returns — investors literally paid to hold them, the ultimate 'low risk premium for a valuable (bad-times-payoff) asset' illustration.",

      pitfall: "Assets with a POSITIVE payoff in bad times are valuable (high price, low/negative expected return) — the SDF-beta relationship inverts the usual sign, since it's measuring cov(Rᵢ, m), not cov(Rᵢ, R_M) directly.",

    { wrong: "\"An asset with a positive payoff during bad times should have a high expected return, since it's valuable.\"", right: "The opposite — an asset with a positive payoff in bad times is valuable PRECISELY because it's a hedge, so investors bid its price up and its expected return DOWN. Valuable assets have low risk premiums." },
    { wrong: "\"Losses during any market downturn are automatically 'bad times' losses deserving compensation.\"", right: "Bad times must be carefully defined relative to the INVESTOR — an investor who is short the market benefits, not loses, during a market downturn, so a downturn isn't universally 'bad times' for every investor." }

  recall: [
    { q: "Why are hedge funds not considered a 'factor' in factor theory, even though they clearly carry risk?", a: "Hedge funds are an ASSET (or asset category) that BUNDLES multiple underlying factor exposures — equity risk, interest rate risk, volatility risk, default risk, and more — rather than representing a single, distinct risk factor themselves. Only things like the market portfolio represent a factor directly." },
    { q: "During the 2007-09 crisis, certain safe-haven assets (gold, government bonds) had negative expected returns — investors paid to hold them. Explain this using CAPM's sixth lesson.", a: "CAPM's sixth lesson states that valuable assets — those with positive payoffs during bad times — command LOW (or even negative) risk premiums, because investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the hedge these assets provide against bad-times losses. Safe havens performing well exactly when the broader market crashed made them extremely valuable, bidding their prices up and their expected returns down to negative." },
    { q: "Explain the CAPM assumption violated when large institutional investors trade on private information and move market prices with their trades.", a: "This violates the 'all investors are price takers' assumption — CAPM assumes no single investor's trades affect market prices, but in reality, large institutional investors are often price SETTERS, not price takers, especially when trading on special/private knowledge." },
    { q: "What is the Grossman-Stiglitz paradox, and why does it complicate the claim that markets are efficient with costless information?", a: "If information were truly costless and prices already fully reflected all information, there would be no incentive for anyone to actually collect that information (since it provides no edge). But if no one collects information, it CANNOT be reflected in prices, contradicting the premise of full informational efficiency — a circular, self-undermining argument that complicates the pure costless-information efficient market claim." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "Bundles, not building blocks", text: "Think of every complex asset (a hedge fund, a corporate bond, private equity) as a gift basket — inside is a bundle of factor exposures (equity, rate, vol, default risk). The 'factor' is what's inside the basket, never the basket itself." },
    { title: "Valuable = cheap risk premium", text: "The single most counter-intuitive CAPM lesson: an asset that pays off when everything else is burning is VALUABLE — so valuable investors bid its price up and accept a low (even negative) return to own it. Value and risk premium move in opposite directions for a genuine hedge." },
    { title: "The paradox that eats its own tail", text: "If information is truly free, nobody bothers to gather it. If nobody gathers it, prices can't reflect it. Grossman-Stiglitz shows perfectly efficient markets are logically self-defeating — a small dose of inefficiency is what PAYS people to make markets efficient in the first place." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Factor theory</strong>: factors (not assets) earn risk premiums; assets are bundles of factors; investors have differing optimal factor exposures. <strong>CAPM</strong> (single factor, market beta): six lessons — hold the factor, own optimal exposure, average investor=100% market, factor risk must be rewarded, risk=beta, valuable (bad-times-payoff) assets have LOW premiums. Seven shortcomings: financial-wealth-only, mean-variance utility, single-period horizon, homogeneous expectations, frictionless markets (NO taxes/costs, not uniform), price-taking, free information. <strong>Multifactor models</strong> (e.g., APT) generalize to multiple factors; the <strong>SDF/pricing kernel</strong> (m) generalizes further, allowing nonlinear bad-times indexing — CAPM is the linear special case. <strong>EMH</strong>: speculative trading is costly, active managers can't generally beat the market, but EMH still identifies exploitable inefficiencies; Grossman-Stiglitz paradox questions truly costless information.</p>`
