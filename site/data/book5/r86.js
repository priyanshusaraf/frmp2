  title: "VaR and Risk Budgeting in Investment Management",
  tagline: "Risk budgeting is top-down: set a total risk (VaR) tolerance for the whole portfolio, then allocate that risk budget across asset classes and active managers — not just allocate market value.",

  teaches: `<p>Risk budgeting's definition; buy-side vs. sell-side differences in horizon/turnover/leverage; the large-investor investment process (strategic allocation → manager selection); hedge fund risk challenges; absolute vs. relative risk, policy-mix vs. active risk; funding risk and surplus at risk (SaR); plan sponsor risk; VaR for compliance monitoring; VaR-based investment guidelines; and budgeting risk across asset classes and active managers.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Risk budgeting is fundamentally different from market-value allocation — you're allocating a scarce RISK budget, not dollars, and because assets aren't perfectly correlated, the sum of individual VaRs always exceeds the actual portfolio VaR. Ignoring this (focusing on stand-alone VaR) leads to systematically wrong manager/asset selection.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Buy-side (asset managers, pension funds) and sell-side (banks) have structurally different risk profiles: sell-side trades rapidly with high leverage (needs forward-looking, dynamic VaR); buy-side holds positions for years with lower leverage (has historically relied on tracking error/benchmarking, but is increasingly adopting VaR as investing globalizes and complexifies).</p>
  <p>The reading's central numeric lesson: focusing on STAND-ALONE VaR when choosing between two candidate positions can lead to the WRONG choice, because what matters is each candidate's CORRELATION with the existing portfolio, not its isolated risk. A lower-stand-alone-VaR asset with high correlation to existing holdings can push total portfolio VaR over budget, while a higher-stand-alone-VaR asset with zero correlation keeps you under budget — correlation, not stand-alone risk, determines the actual incremental VaR impact.</p>
  <p>Funding risk (relevant mainly to pension funds) reframes VaR around the SURPLUS (assets − liabilities): surplus at risk (SaR) asks how much the surplus could shrink, accounting for the fact that liabilities themselves move (often in the SAME direction as assets when rates change, but not necessarily by the same amount) — ironically, falling rates can raise both asset values AND the present value of future obligations, sometimes leaving the surplus worse off despite rising asset values.</p>`,

  recall: [
    { q: "A $500M position in W (σ=10%) is being supplemented with either X (σ=9%, ρ=0.7 with W) or Y (σ=12%, ρ=0 with W), 99% confidence, VaR budget $200M. Why might the lower-stand-alone-VaR choice (X) actually be the wrong pick?", a: "X's stand-alone VaR ($104.9M) is indeed lower than Y's ($139.8M), but X's HIGH correlation (0.7) with the existing W position means adding X barely diversifies the portfolio — the combined portfolio VaR with X exceeds the $200M budget. Y's ZERO correlation with W means it genuinely diversifies the portfolio, keeping combined VaR within budget despite Y's higher stand-alone risk. The correlation-driven INCREMENTAL VaR impact, not stand-alone VaR, determines the correct choice." },
    { q: "Why can a pension fund's funding surplus actually shrink when interest rates fall, even though its bond and equity holdings gain value?", a: "Falling rates raise the present value of BOTH the fund's assets AND its future pension liabilities (since liabilities are also discounted at market rates). If the liabilities' duration exceeds the assets' duration (a common real-world mismatch for pension funds), the liabilities' present value rises by MORE than the assets' value — shrinking the surplus (assets−liabilities) even as the absolute asset value increases." },
    { q: "Why is active management risk (managers deviating from target weights) usually not a major concern, and under what circumstance does this change?", a: "For well-managed funds, individual managers' deviations are typically small, and diversification effects occur ACROSS different managers' independent deviations (and even between policy-mix risk and active risk), often lowering total portfolio VaR. This changes when managers, acting independently, happen to make the SAME style shift simultaneously (e.g., all bond managers moving to long-duration bonds on a shared rate-decline forecast) — this concentrates rather than diversifies risk, defeating the usual diversification benefit." },
    { q: "A firm targets a portfolio volatility of 15%, has $150 million AUM, and wants 95% VaR. What is the VaR budget, and what does the budgeting process require when allocating this across asset classes?", a: "VaR = 1.65×0.15×$150M = $37.125 million. The budgeting process must account for diversification — since asset classes aren't perfectly correlated, simply summing each asset class's stand-alone VaR would overstate true portfolio risk; the actual combined portfolio VaR (which must stay within the $37.125M budget) depends on the correlations between asset classes, not just their individual volatilities." }

  hooks: [
    { title: "The lower-risk asset that isn't", text: "X looks safer alone (lower stand-alone VaR) — but tied to W by a thick rope (0.7 correlation), it barely diversifies anything. Y looks riskier alone but is untethered (zero correlation) — the untethered asset is the one that actually keeps you within budget." },
    { title: "The rising boat, the rising dock", text: "Falling rates lift the pension fund's assets (the boat) — but they can lift the present value of its liabilities (the dock) even higher. The gap between boat and dock (the surplus) can shrink even while both rise." },
    { title: "Passive doesn't mean static", text: "A benchmark-tracking fund isn't 'set it and forget it' — the benchmark itself quietly reshapes its own risk profile over time (tech concentration creeping into the S&P 500 in the late '90s is the textbook example)." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Risk budgeting</strong>: top-down, allocates RISK (not market value). <strong>Buy side</strong> (long horizon, low leverage, adopting VaR) vs. <strong>sell side</strong> (fast trading, high leverage, VaR-native). <strong>Investment process</strong>: strategic allocation → manager selection. <strong>Hedge funds</strong>: sell-side-like leverage/turnover PLUS liquidity risk (understates vol/correlation) and low transparency. <strong>Absolute risk</strong> (total loss) vs. <strong>relative risk</strong> (excess return/tracking error); <strong>policy-mix risk</strong> (target weights) vs. <strong>active risk</strong> (deviations — usually small, UNLESS managers correlate their bets). <strong>Funding risk/SaR</strong>: surplus=assets−liabilities; falling rates can shrink the surplus despite raising asset values (liability duration mismatch). <strong>Plan sponsor risk</strong>: economic risk + cash flow risk. <strong>VaR monitoring</strong> catches rogue traders and tracks even passive portfolios' evolving risk. <strong>VaR guidelines</strong> beat notional limits (ignore correlations, easily circumvented). <strong>Budgeting across asset classes</strong>: stand-alone VaR can mislead — correlation with existing holdings (incremental VaR) determines the right choice. <strong>Budgeting across managers</strong>: weight ∝ IRᵢ/IR_P, remainder to the (zero-IR) benchmark.</p>`
