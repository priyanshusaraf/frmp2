  title: "Portfolio Performance Evaluation",
  tagline: "The full toolkit: time- vs. dollar-weighted returns, Sharpe/Treynor/Jensen's alpha/information ratio/M², statistical significance of alpha, hedge fund evaluation challenges, dynamic-risk manipulation, market timing measurement, and Sharpe's style analysis.",

  teaches: `<p>Time-weighted vs. dollar-weighted returns; Sharpe ratio, Treynor measure, Jensen's alpha, information ratio, and M²; the statistical significance test for alpha; hedge fund performance measurement challenges; performance manipulation via dynamic risk; measuring market timing (regression and call-option approaches); and Sharpe's style analysis (asset allocation vs. selection attribution).</p>`,

  why: `<p>Different performance measures answer different questions and can DISAGREE with each other. Knowing when Sharpe and Treynor diverge (a diversification signal), why dollar-weighted returns penalize bad market timing, and how a manager can game the Sharpe ratio by switching risk levels mid-evaluation — these are the practical, frequently-tested traps in performance evaluation.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p><strong>Time-weighted</strong> return isolates the MANAGER's skill by removing the effect of cash-flow timing (which the manager often doesn't control). <strong>Dollar-weighted</strong> return (IRR) gives MORE WEIGHT to periods when more money was invested — so it reflects the INVESTOR's actual experience, including their own (or the manager's) timing luck. If a manager has genuine market-timing skill (adding money right before good periods), dollar-weighted return will EXCEED time-weighted return.</p>
  <p>Sharpe (risk = total σ) vs. Treynor (risk = β only) DIVERGE exactly when diversification is imperfect — a poorly-diversified portfolio can rank HIGHER under Treynor (which ignores unsystematic risk) than under Sharpe (which penalizes it), and the SIZE of that ranking gap is itself a signal of how undiversified the portfolio is.</p>
  <p>The Sharpe ratio can be GAMED by dynamic risk-shifting: a manager who runs a low-risk strategy one year (Sharpe 0.333, "beats" the market's 0.3) and a high-risk strategy the next year (Sharpe again 0.333, still "beats" the market) can show a COMBINED two-year Sharpe ratio of only 0.2727 — WORSE than the market — because volatility compounds nonlinearly across regime changes. Evaluating year-by-year and combined can give opposite conclusions.</p>
  <p>Sharpe's style analysis found (Magellan Fund, 1985-89) that 97.3% of returns were explained by STYLE (asset allocation) bets, only 2.7% by SELECTION (security-picking/market-timing) bets — a landmark finding that asset allocation dominates, and that timing/selection skill is rare and often not worth its costs.</p>`,

      example: "Buy 1 share $100 (t=0), buy 1 more $120 (t=1, after $2 dividend), sell both $130 each (t=2, after $2 dividend each): dollar-weighted IRR=13.86%; time-weighted=15.84% (Year 1 HPR=22%, Year 2 HPR=10%, geometric mean). The gap exists because dollar-weighting gives MORE weight to Year 2 (when more capital — $220 — was invested) which had the LOWER 10% return.",

  misconceptions: [

  recall: [
    { q: "A manager contributes a large sum to a client's account right before a period of unusually poor performance, entirely due to a client-directed timing decision the manager didn't control. Which return measure will be unfairly depressed, and which measure should be used to fairly evaluate the manager?", a: "The dollar-weighted (IRR) return will be depressed, since it weights the poor-performing period more heavily due to the larger capital base invested during it. The time-weighted return removes this distortion by treating each subperiod's return equally regardless of capital size, providing a fairer measure of the manager's actual security-selection skill, independent of client-driven cash-flow timing." },
    { q: "A portfolio ranks much higher under the Treynor measure than under the Sharpe ratio. What does this discrepancy suggest about the portfolio?", a: "It suggests the portfolio is NOT well-diversified — Treynor only penalizes systematic (beta) risk, while Sharpe penalizes total risk (including unsystematic/diversifiable risk). A large ranking gap between the two indicates a meaningful amount of unsystematic risk is being carried, which Sharpe punishes but Treynor ignores entirely." },
    { q: "A manager's Sharpe ratio is 0.333 in each of two individual years (low-risk then high-risk strategy), both beating the market's 0.3. Yet the combined two-year Sharpe ratio is only 0.2727. How is this possible, and what lesson does it teach about performance evaluation?", a: "Each year in isolation showed a favorable excess-return-to-volatility ratio. But combining the two very different risk regimes into one period doesn't simply average their Sharpe ratios — the COMBINED volatility (reflecting the swing between low-risk and high-risk states) rises disproportionately relative to the combined average excess return, dragging the overall ratio below the market's. The lesson: dynamic (changing) risk levels across an evaluation period can bias the Sharpe ratio in ways that produce misleading conclusions if you only look at sub-period results or only the combined result in isolation." },
    { q: "What did Sharpe's style analysis of the Fidelity Magellan Fund (1985-1989) conclude about the sources of the fund's returns, and what practical implication does this carry?", a: "97.3% of the fund's returns were explained by style bets (asset allocation across asset classes), while only 2.7% were attributable to selection bets (individual security picking and market timing). The practical implication: long-run asset allocation decisions dominate investment outcomes, while security selection and market timing contribute little — and their benefits may not even be sufficient to cover the associated operating expenses and trading costs of pursuing them actively." }
