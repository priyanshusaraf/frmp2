  title: "Climate-Related Financial Risks — Measurement Methodologies",
  tagline: "How do you put a number on a risk that hasn't happened yet, is missing its own data, and might take 30 years to arrive?",

  teaches: "This reading is the 'now measure it' sequel to R97 (which mapped how climate risk transmits into credit/market/liquidity/operational risk). Here the Basel Committee's 2021 report asks: given those transmission channels, what data do banks and supervisors actually need, what modeling approaches exist today (IAMs, CGE, DSGE, ABMs, stress testing), what broad measurement approaches are banks using (ratings/scores, scenario analysis, climate VaR, natural capital analysis), and — critically — where does the whole measurement enterprise still fall short (data gaps, time-horizon mismatches, comparability across jurisdictions).",

  why: "Every other climate reading (R97, and the disclosure/scenario material elsewhere) assumes measurement is possible. This reading is the reality check: climate risk measurement is still in its infancy, existing models systematically understate tail/extreme-event severity, and there is no common accounting standard for climate data. For the exam, this reading is a taxonomy-heavy one — expect matching questions (top-down vs bottom-up, gross vs net exposure, IAM vs ABM vs CGE) and 'which of the following is NOT a challenge' questions.",

  intuition: "Think of climate risk measurement as building a bridge between two things that don't naturally talk to each other: (1) physical/climate science (temperature paths, flood probabilities, carbon budgets) and (2) financial risk parameters (PD, LGD, EAD, VaR). Every methodology in this reading is an attempt at that translation, and every one of them leaks somewhere — either the physical science is uncertain (data gaps, model-based uncertainty), the translation step is crude (top-down averages, gross vs net), or the time horizon (up to 30 years) exceeds anything financial models were built to handle. The five Basel findings essentially say: we're translating transition risk into credit risk reasonably well; everything else (physical risk, non-credit risk categories, long-horizon nonstandard issues) is still underdeveloped.",

  formulas: [
    {
      name: "Gross exposure vs. net exposure",
      math: "Net exposure = Gross exposure − mitigation benefits (insurance + hedges)",
      note: "Gross exposure is the climate risk impact BEFORE any mitigation is applied — it should still be modeled and disclosed separately even when mitigants exist, because mitigants can lapse, fail, or change over time. Net exposure nets out insurance and derivatives hedging benefits. Both numbers matter; reporting only net exposure hides fragility if the mitigation disappears."
    }
  ],

  concepts: [
    {
      name: "Five Basel Committee findings (2021 report)",
      def: "(1) Forward-looking, granular methodologies are needed because climate risk is unlike traditional financial risk; (2) banks/supervisors have focused on mapping near-term transition risk into portfolio/counterparty exposures; (3) the primary financial risk category translated so far is credit risk; (4) the pace of translation into quantifiable risk has increased; (5) future work is needed on measurement gaps and nonstandard, long-term issues.",
      intuition: "Read this as a progress report: transition risk → credit risk is the frontier that's furthest along. Everything else (physical risk, other risk categories, long-horizon issues) is behind.",
      example: "A bank that has built a granular carbon-intensity-based credit scoring overlay for its corporate loan book is doing exactly what finding #2/#3 describe — but if it has no equivalent framework for physical risk to its mortgage book, that gap is exactly what finding #5 flags.",
      counter: "It would be wrong to assume progress on transition-risk-to-credit-risk means climate risk measurement generally is mature — the report explicitly says other risk categories (liquidity, operational) and physical risk lag far behind.",
      pitfall: "Exam trap: the five findings are about DIRECTION of progress (what's been done, what's next), not a ranking of risk severity. Physical risk isn't 'less important' — it's just methodologically less developed.",
      related: ["Three uncertainty areas", "Transition vs physical risk measurement"],

      name: "Three areas of uncertainty",
      def: "(1) Intrinsic uncertainty in physical/transition risk driver projections; (2) data gaps creating measurement uncertainty; (3) model-based uncertainty.",
      intuition: "Three independent reasons a climate risk number could be wrong: the underlying science itself is uncertain, you don't have the data you need even if the science were certain, and your model of how climate maps to financial outcomes is itself a simplification.",
      example: "Even with perfect emissions data (removing #2), you still don't know how severe a 2°C world's flood frequency will be in your specific region (#1), and even with a good flood forecast, your damage function mapping flood depth to mortgage default probability is a crude approximation (#3).",
      counter: "These aren't the same as garden-variety financial model risk — the time horizons (decades) and lack of historical precedent make climate model uncertainty structurally worse than, say, credit risk model uncertainty calibrated on decades of loss data.",
      pitfall: "Don't collapse all three into 'data problems' — model-based uncertainty persists even with perfect data, because the model itself simplifies complex climate-economy interactions.",
      related: ["Sources of uncertainty", "Damage functions"],
      memory: "Science uncertain, data missing, model crude — three separate leaks in the same pipe."

      intuition: "This is the pipeline: first figure out WHAT could hurt you and HOW (R97), then figure out WHERE you're exposed and by HOW MUCH, then put a NUMBER on it, then decide what to DO about it.",
      example: "A bank first identifies that transition risk affects its oil & gas loan book (identification), then maps which specific loans/counterparties are carbon-intensive (exposure mapping), then runs a scenario analysis estimating credit losses under a disorderly transition (quantification), then adjusts underwriting standards or exits the sector (management).",

    {
      name: "Transition risk vs. physical risk measurement",
      def: "Transition risk arises from the shift from a high-carbon to low-carbon economy. Physical risk drivers/hazards apply to financial exposures through damage functions, which are driven by time horizon, hazard severity, location, and sector. Though often assessed separately, they have dependencies — rising physical risk can create policy pressure that raises transition risk.",
      intuition: "A damage function is the translator: 'this much flooding, in this location, in this sector, over this time horizon → this much financial damage.' It's the physical-risk equivalent of a PD model.",
      example: "If sea levels rise faster than expected (physical risk materializing), governments may accelerate carbon regulation in response (transition risk rising) — the two aren't independent.",
      counter: "Don't assume assessing them 'in tandem' means combining them into one number — the reading says dependencies 'may merit' joint assessment, not that separate assessment is wrong.",
      pitfall: "A classic exam wrong-answer pattern: implying physical and transition risk are always independent, or always must be modeled jointly. The correct nuance is 'usually separate, but interdependencies matter.'",

Driven by data availability, risk driver type, computational complexity, and the decision the assessment supports.",
      intuition: "More granular = more accurate for a specific decision (like underwriting one loan) but more expensive and data-hungry. Less granular = cheaper and more robust to sporadic data, but blunt — good for strategic/portfolio-level decisions, useless for pricing one deal.",
      example: "A bank pricing a single mortgage in a flood zone needs high-granularity, property-level flood data. A bank deciding whether to reduce overall oil & gas sector exposure by 10% can use low-granularity, sector-average carbon intensity data.",
      counter: "High granularity isn't strictly 'better' — the reading explicitly says higher granularity models 'suffer from input data quality' and are more complex; the right granularity depends on the use case.",

Bottom-up: measure risk at the individual loan/counterparty level and aggregate up to portfolio/sector views; challenge is capturing correlations among exposures.",
      intuition: "Top-down is 'assume everyone in this sector looks alike.' Bottom-up is 'assess everyone individually, then add it up' — more accurate per-exposure, but you have to worry about how those exposures move together (correlation), which top-down implicitly ignores.",
      example: "Top-down: applying an 'oil & gas sector' transition risk score to every oil & gas loan uniformly. Bottom-up: scoring each individual oil & gas borrower's specific transition exposure and summing.",

      intuition: "Gross tells you the worst case / raw magnitude; net tells you what you're actually exposed to today. Modeling them separately matters because mitigation strategies 'may change, lapse, or fail to function as designed' — net exposure alone hides that fragility.",
      example: "See the worked module quiz: $35mm gross risk, minus $15mm insurance benefit, minus $3mm derivatives benefit → gross exposure is still $35 million (the question asks for GROSS, which ignores mitigation entirely); net would be $17 million.",

Climate risk is fairly similar within a sector even if individual clients differ; policy/regulation can differ by client.",

      intuition: "This is a three-stage data pipeline mirroring the four-stage framework: raw climate data → exposure/vulnerability data → financial impact data. Each stage requires progressively more bank-specific, proprietary information.",

Sensitivity analysis shows volatility of projected losses from tail-event probabilities but also underestimates tail risk. Input-output models estimate economic impact of policy shifts on a region/industry. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models test policy experiments with complex agent/sector interactions but are limited by complexity. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models manage complexity at high computational cost. Overlapping generation (OLG) models transparently model long-term macro evolution. Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate individual/institutional interactions and handle complexity/uncertainty well, but are computation- and data-hungry with unclear internal mechanisms. Stress testing links portfolio risk to these modeling approaches.",
      intuition: "Each model is a different trade-off between realism, transparency, and computational tractability. None of them handle extreme/tail climate events well — that's the recurring weakness across IAMs and sensitivity analysis specifically.",
      example: "A central bank wanting a transparent, long-horizon view of how an economy evolves under a carbon tax over 40 years might favor an OLG model; a modeler wanting to capture emergent, hard-to-predict interactions between firms and consumers reacting to climate policy might use an ABM instead.",

Time horizons for climate risk (up to 30 years) vastly exceed typical capital planning (2-3 years) and strategic planning (3-5 years) horizons. Balance sheets can be modeled as static (illustrates current exposure, less reliable long-term) or dynamic (captures strategic adjustments).",

  summary: "The Basel Committee's 2021 report finds climate risk measurement most mature where transition risk maps into credit risk, and still immature everywhere else — physical risk, other risk categories, and long-horizon nonstandard issues. Three data categories feed the pipeline: raw climate/hazard data, exposure-vulnerability data, and financial-impact data. A wide toolkit of models exists (IAM, sensitivity analysis, input-output, CGE, DSGE, OLG, ABM, stress testing), each trading off realism, transparency, and computational cost — and all of them tend to understate extreme/tail events. Broad measurement approaches (ratings/scores, scenario analysis — which contains stress testing and sensitivity analysis as forms — natural capital analysis, climate VaR) turn these models into bank- and supervisor-facing outputs. Key structural challenges recur throughout: the granularity/complexity trade-off (high for underwriting, low for strategy), gross vs. net exposure (model both), a stark time-horizon mismatch (climate horizons up to 30 years vs. 2-5 year capital/strategic planning), persistent data gaps (no common accounting standards, opaque third-party scrubbing, qualitative-heavy small-counterparty data), and comparability obstacles across jurisdictions and consolidated banking groups."
