  title: "Alpha (and the Low-Risk Anomaly)",
  tagline: "Alpha is benchmark-relative excess return — and the low-risk anomaly defies CAPM: lower-beta, lower-volatility stocks have historically produced HIGHER risk-adjusted returns than riskier ones.",

  teaches: `<p>The low-risk anomaly; alpha, tracking error, information ratio, and Sharpe ratio definitions and calculations; benchmark selection criteria; Grinold's fundamental law of active management; factor regression for multi-factor benchmarks; style analysis for time-varying exposures; nonlinear-strategy alpha measurement issues; the volatility and beta anomalies; and explanations for the risk anomaly.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Alpha is often treated as "proof of skill" — but it's really just a statement of average performance relative to a CHOSEN benchmark, and the choice of benchmark can make alpha appear or disappear. The low-risk anomaly is one of the most-tested empirical challenges to CAPM in the whole curriculum.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Alpha (α) = excess return over a benchmark, averaged. But which benchmark? If you benchmark an investment with true beta 0.73 against a raw index (implicitly assuming beta=1.0), you'll UNDERSTATE its true alpha — using the wrong benchmark risk level biases the answer. A proper benchmark must be well-defined, tradeable, replicable, AND risk-adjusted.</p>
  <p>Grinold's fundamental law formalizes the active-manager trade-off: IR ≈ IC×√BR. You can win with a HIGH information coefficient (great forecasts) and few bets, OR a LOW information coefficient and MANY bets (breadth) — investors must either "play smart" or "play often."</p>
  <p>The low-risk anomaly (also seen as the volatility anomaly and beta anomaly) is a genuine CAPM violation: low-beta/low-volatility stocks show HIGHER Sharpe ratios than high-beta/high-volatility stocks — the opposite of CAPM's prediction. No single explanation is fully satisfying; the leading candidates are leverage-constrained investors (who buy high-beta stocks as a substitute for borrowing, bidding their prices up and future returns down) and institutional constraints (short-selling prohibitions, tracking-error limits preventing managers from exploiting the anomaly).</p>`,

      example: "An investment with true beta=0.73 benchmarked naively against the raw S&P 500 (beta=1.0 assumption) understates its alpha (1.50% naive vs. 3.44% correctly beta-adjusted) and understates its IR (0.2435 vs. 0.5584 correct) — using the wrong (too risky) benchmark makes a good investment look worse than it is.",

As assets under management (AUM) grow, IC tends to DECLINE (harder to find high-quality opportunities at scale) — a documented reason funds close to new investment.",

      example: "Beta anomaly: high-beta stocks show LOWER Sharpe ratios (0.4) than low-beta stocks (0.9) — NOT because high-beta stocks have low absolute returns (they don't), but because higher betas pair with higher volatility, which sits in the Sharpe ratio's DENOMINATOR.",

  misconceptions: [
    { wrong: "\"Alpha is a pure measure of manager skill.\"", right: "Alpha is really just average performance relative to a CHOSEN benchmark — the benchmark's appropriateness (risk-adjustment in particular) directly determines the calculated alpha, so alpha can be inflated or deflated by benchmark choice alone, independent of actual skill." },
    { wrong: "\"Using a benchmark riskier than the actual investment will overstate that investment's alpha.\"", right: "It will UNDERSTATE alpha (and IR) — a too-risky benchmark implies a higher expected return baseline, making the actual investment's excess return look smaller than its true, properly risk-adjusted alpha." },
    { wrong: "\"Grinold's fundamental law shows that placing fewer bets always improves expected performance.\"", right: "The law shows a TRADE-OFF: IR≈IC×√BR — fewer bets require a correspondingly HIGHER information coefficient (better forecasts) to achieve the same IR; fewer bets alone doesn't improve anything without also having better forecasting skill." },
    { wrong: "\"The beta anomaly means high-beta stocks have lower average returns than low-beta stocks.\"", right: "High-beta stocks don't necessarily have LOWER raw returns — they have lower Sharpe ratios (risk-adjusted returns), because their higher volatility (the Sharpe ratio's denominator) grows faster than their returns." },
    { wrong: "\"Data mining is a well-supported explanation for the low-risk anomaly, just as it is for the size effect.\"", right: "Data mining is explicitly NOT well supported for the risk anomaly — it persists across recessions and expansions, and across multiple asset classes (bonds, options, commodities), unlike the size effect where data mining is a more plausible explanation." },
    { wrong: "\"A statistically significant positive alpha from a linear regression always indicates genuine manager skill.\"", right: "Nonlinear strategies (merger arbitrage, convertible bond arbitrage, uncovered long puts) can produce a FALSE POSITIVE alpha under standard linear regression, because their non-normal, negatively-skewed return distributions aren't properly captured by a linear model." }

  recall: [
    { q: "An analyst benchmarks a fund with a true beta of 0.6 against the raw S&P 500 (implicitly assuming beta=1.0). Will the calculated alpha be overstated or understated, and why?", a: "Understated. Since the fund's true beta (0.6) is lower than the benchmark's implicit beta (1.0), the benchmark is RISKIER than the actual investment — this means the benchmark's expected return (given by CAPM) is too high relative to what the fund should actually be compared against, making the fund's calculated excess return (alpha) look smaller than its true, properly risk-adjusted alpha." },
    { q: "An investor wants an information ratio of 0.40. If they place only 2 independent bets per year, what information coefficient (IC) do they need? What if they place 100 bets?", a: "Using IR≈IC×√BR: with BR=2, IC=0.40/√2≈0.283 (need quite high-quality forecasts). With BR=100, IC=0.40/√100=0.040 (much lower forecast quality suffices) — illustrating the fundamental trade-off between forecasting skill and breadth of bets." },
    { q: "Why can a merger arbitrage hedge fund strategy show a statistically significant positive alpha under standard linear regression, even if the manager has no genuine skill?", a: "Merger arbitrage has a NONLINEAR, option-like payoff profile (limited upside if the deal closes, sharp downside if it fails) — this produces a non-normal, typically negatively-skewed return distribution. Standard linear regression doesn't account for skewness, so it can misattribute the strategy's risk-return profile as 'alpha' when it's actually just compensation for bearing a specific, non-diversifiable tail risk that the linear model fails to capture." },
    { q: "Why is 'data mining' considered a weak explanation for the low-risk/volatility/beta anomaly, in contrast to the disappearing size effect?", a: "The size effect was a single empirical finding that vanished after publication — consistent with a data-mined, in-sample artifact. The low-risk anomaly, by contrast, has been found robustly across MULTIPLE independent studies, across BOTH recessions and expansions, and across MULTIPLE asset classes (U.S. and international stocks, Treasury and corporate bonds, options, commodities) — this breadth and persistence argues strongly against a simple data-mining explanation." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Low-risk anomaly</strong>: CAPM violation — low-beta/low-vol stocks show HIGHER risk-adjusted returns. <strong>Alpha</strong>=avg excess return vs benchmark (active return); <strong>tracking error</strong>=SD of excess returns; <strong>IR</strong>=α/TE; <strong>Sharpe</strong>=α/σ (vs risk-free benchmark). Good benchmarks: well-defined, tradeable, replicable, risk-adjusted — a too-risky benchmark understates alpha/IR. <strong>Grinold's law</strong>: IR≈IC×√BR — play smart (high IC, few bets) or play often (many independent bets); IC tends to fall as AUM grows. <strong>Factor regression</strong> (Fama-French + UMD) builds multi-factor benchmarks; <strong>style analysis</strong> uses tradeable ETFs with time-varying (re-estimated each period) factor loadings, fixing Fama-French's untradeable-index problem. <strong>Nonlinear strategies</strong> (merger arb, convertible arb) can show false-positive alpha under linear regression due to skewness. <strong>Volatility anomaly</strong> (higher SD → lower return AND lower Sharpe) and <strong>beta anomaly</strong> (higher beta → lower Sharpe, via the vol denominator, not necessarily lower raw return). Explanations: data mining (NOT well supported), leverage-constrained investors (buy high-beta as leverage substitute), institutional constraints (short-sale/tracking-error limits), investor preferences.</p>`
