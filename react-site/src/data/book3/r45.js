  topicTags: ["op-risk", "governance", "basel", "capital"],

  teaches: `<p>The organizational committees that consume operational risk reports and what each one needs (risk committee, audit committee, ExCo, central operational risk function, business line managers), the "reporting cake" (three tiers matching report detail to audience seniority), the seven components of a comprehensive internal ORM report, the specific challenges of op risk reporting (data asymmetry, escalation, small frequent losses, benchmarking, non-normal distributions, qualitative aggregation), and external reporting: Pillar 3 disclosure plus regulatory notification triggers and combined assurance.</p>`,

  why: `<p>A report with the wrong altitude for its audience is useless: a board doesn't need daily transaction-level KRI detail, and a front-line manager can't act on a high-level board summary. Reporting is the final, and easiest to get wrong, step in the risk management chain: you can identify risks well (R42), measure them well (R43), and mitigate them well (R44), and still fail the firm if the information never reaches the person with the authority and context to act on it: or reaches them buried in noise. Getting the "reporting cake" right, matching each committee's mandate to its report, and being honest about what operational loss data actually looks like (skewed, not bell-shaped) is what makes the entire identify-measure-mitigate pipeline actually useful instead of just an exercise in paperwork.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Start from who is reading the report and what they are allowed to do about it: that's the whole logic of this reading. A <strong>business line manager</strong> owns a specific process day-to-day, so they get the raw, full data set, refreshed daily: at this level there's no real distinction between "monitoring" (watching the numbers) and "reporting" (writing them up): it's the same activity. The <strong>central operational risk function</strong> (the second line of defense) sits above all the business lines: it collects and aggregates what they report, so it can spot patterns no single business line would see on its own, and passes an aggregated picture up to the <strong>operational risk committee</strong> and the <strong>risk committee</strong>. The <strong>risk committee</strong> (a board of directors subcommittee) needs enough detail to confirm controls are actually working and the firm is inside its board-approved risk appetite, so it gets summaries plus the detail on the events that matter (KRIs, large-event investigations, frequency/severity). The <strong>audit committee</strong> is a step removed again: it doesn't monitor risk day-to-day, it receives independent assurance from internal audit (the third line of defense) that the first two lines are doing their jobs. The <strong>executive committee (ExCo)</strong> is the board's steering group: it needs the same broad picture (exposures, trends, events, action plans, culture) but framed for decision-making and governance, not operational detail.</p>
<p>Once you have that audience logic, the "reporting cake" is just the same idea formalized into three named tiers, from the ground up: Tier 1 (business line managers: everything, daily), Tier 2 (operational risk committee: only what needs a decision, monthly/quarterly), Tier 3 (executive/board risk committee: high-level trends and strategic progress only). Detail shrinks as you move up, because the cost of reading noise scales with how many other things that reader is responsible for.</p>
<p>The reporting <em>challenges</em> section is really one big idea applied several ways: operational loss data does not look like the tidy, symmetric distributions used in most finance formulas. A handful of catastrophic events dominate; most events are small and frequent and barely move the needle; and even "risk scores" (red/amber/yellow/green) can't be averaged the way numbers can. Every specific challenge in Module 45.3 (data asymmetry, escalation, small losses, benchmarking, non-normal distributions, qualitative aggregation) is a different symptom of that same underlying fact, and the fix in each case is the same instinct: don't collapse the data into one deceptively simple summary statistic (a mean, an average color) without checking whether that statistic actually represents anything real.</p>`,

      example: "A firm's GRC (governance, risk, and compliance) system is the software layer that actually makes all seven components possible at scale: it collects and collates the underlying risk data, links individual risks to the specific controls meant to mitigate them, and auto-generates the tier-appropriate reports for each audience.",

      def: "Cost-benefit test first, any reporting decision should pass three checks: the cost of collecting the data must be less than its value, the content must actually align with entity priorities, and the report must be capable of influencing a decision (even a decision to do nothing). Beyond that, event data asymmetry means losses are heavily skewed away from the mean: a few high-severity, low-frequency events dominate, while many high-frequency, low-severity events barely affect the loss budget, so resources should target the big rare events, not the visible-but-trivial ones. Large event escalation: events and near-misses above the firm's risk tolerance must go to upper management with root-cause analysis and a documented action plan. Small, frequent losses: individually immaterial to the budget, but worth regular review since a pattern of them can reveal a structural control gap. Operational loss benchmarking: comparing losses across business lines/entities using a common yardstick (basis points of regulatory capital, or percentage of gross income/budget) so entities of different sizes are comparable. Distribution shape: op risk losses are not symmetric or bell-shaped, so the mean is misleading; median and first/third quartiles describe the 'typical' loss more honestly, and the same applies to risk ratings, KPIs, and KRIs, not just losses. Concentrations, outliers, and scenarios: outliers carry real information (they're where ORM's value actually comes from), so distributions should be examined in full and by subcategory, not just summarized; high/medium/low-risk scenario analysis (e.g., climate-related scenarios) is part of this. Qualitative data aggregation, three ways to combine non-numeric risk scores: conversion and addition (translate qualitative factors like reputational damage into a monetary figure, then sum them), categorization (color/score bands, e.g., red-amber-yellow-green, shown as a bar chart), or worst-case reporting (the whole group is flagged red if even one component in it is red; conservative, but can overstate concern).",
      pitfall: "Reporting a simple MEAN of op risk losses is misleading given the fat-tailed, asymmetric distribution shape: median/quartile-based reporting is more honest. Also don't average qualitative risk scores directly: an extreme risk (Level 1) and a low risk (Level 3) do not average to a moderate risk (Level 2): the categories aren't a real numeric scale.",

Separately from Pillar 3, firms must notify regulators of significant events under four trigger criteria: reputation (events that could materially damage the firm's reputation), resilience (events that could harm customers or disrupt the goods/services delivered to them), materiality (events that exceed a defined loss/materiality threshold), and stability (events that could threaten the wider financial system or the firm's ability to keep operating).",

    { q: "A business line has many small, frequent operational losses that individually barely affect the budget.

  eli5: `<p>Imagine a hospital at shift-change. The nurse on the floor needs the full chart on every patient right now: vitals, meds, everything, refreshed every few hours, because they're the one adjusting a drip today. The head of nursing for the ward only needs to hear about patients whose situation actually requires a decision from her: a bed transfer, a doctor call: summarized once a shift, not every vital sign. The hospital's board doesn't want any of that detail; they want to know infection rates are trending down and the new wing is on schedule, once a quarter. Nobody is lying to anybody, and nobody is being kept in the dark: each person just gets the amount of detail they can actually act on, at the altitude they operate at. That's exactly the "reporting cake": business line managers (the nurse) get the full daily feed, the operational risk committee (the ward head) gets only action-required items, and the board risk committee (the hospital board) gets the high-level headline.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager building an ORM report starts from one question: <em>what decision is this reader empowered to make, and what's the minimum data that lets them make it well?</em> That single question is what forces detail down at the top (a board can't act on a transaction log) and forces completeness at the bottom (a business line manager without full daily data can't actually fix anything). It's also why the exam leans so hard on "which tier / which committee gets X" scenario questions: GARP is testing whether you understand that reporting is designed around decision rights, not just around "who is senior."</p>
<p>The second instinct a practitioner needs is statistical honesty about the shape of operational loss data. Most of finance assumes symmetric, roughly normal distributions where the mean is a sensible summary. Op risk data almost never looks like that: it's dominated by a few catastrophic tail events sitting on top of a mass of trivial small losses: so a risk manager who reports "average loss per quarter" without checking the distribution shape is quietly hiding the exact thing that matters (the tail). Expect exam questions that give you a distorted-looking average and ask you to identify why it's misleading, or ask you to pick median/quartile reporting as the fix.</p>`,

      q: "Using the reporting cake model, which tier receives leading indicators and progress on strategic plans?",
      options: ["Tier 1", "Tier 2", "Tier 3", "There is no such tier: leading indicators aren't reported"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Tier 3 (executive and board risk committee) receives high-level data including leading indicators, performance trends, and strategic-plan progress. Tier 1 gets the full daily metric set, and Tier 2 gets only action-required items: neither is the 'high-level, strategic' altitude leading indicators belong at."

    {
      q: "A risk manager reports that the average (mean) operational loss last quarter was $40,000, and concludes exposure is well controlled. What is the most likely flaw in this conclusion?",
      options: [
        "The mean is always the correct summary statistic for financial data",
        "Operational loss distributions are typically asymmetric and fat-tailed, so a small number of high-severity events can distort the mean; median/quartiles would be more representative",
        "The mean understates risk because operational losses are always understated by firms",
        "Quarterly reporting periods are too short to compute a meaningful mean"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Op risk losses are heavily skewed: a handful of catastrophic, low-frequency events can pull the mean up or down and make 'typical' exposure look different than it is. The fix is median/first-and-third-quartile reporting. The other options either assert something false about means in general or invent unsupported claims about reporting bias/period length."

    {
      q: "Which committee is most directly responsible for providing INDEPENDENT assurance (via internal audit) that a firm's operational risk controls are functioning as intended?",
      options: ["The risk committee", "The audit committee", "The executive committee (ExCo)", "The central operational risk function"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "The audit committee receives third-level, independent assurance through the internal audit function (the third line of defense). The risk committee monitors the framework directly rather than through an independent audit lens; the ExCo is the board's decision-making steering group, not an assurance provider; the central operational risk function is the second line, which oversees but is not independent of the first-line business units the way internal audit is."
    },
    {
      q: "A group of five KRIs is reported to the board. Four are green and one is red. Under 'worst-case reporting,' how should this group be aggregated and presented?",
      options: [
        "As green, since a majority of the KRIs are green",
        "As yellow, as an average of the group's scores",
        "As red, because the group is reported using the worst individual result in it",
        "The KRIs must be reported individually: worst-case reporting cannot aggregate them"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Worst-case reporting is explicitly the most conservative aggregation method: the entire group is flagged with the worst color present, even if only one component is red. Averaging the group's scores isn't valid for qualitative categories, and a majority-vote approach is not how worst-case reporting works by definition."

      q: "Under Basel Pillar 3 operational risk disclosure requirements, how many years of aggregate historical operational losses must generally be disclosed?",
      options: ["3 years", "5 years", "10 years", "15 years"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Pillar 3 requires 10 years of aggregate historical operational losses (paired with the resulting capital calculations). Note this differs from the business indicator component, which uses the last 3 years of data: a common source of confusion on the exam."
    },
    {
      q: "A significant operational risk event has occurred that could disrupt the goods and services a bank delivers to its retail customers, though it does not yet exceed the firm's materiality threshold. Under which regulatory notification trigger would this event most likely still require notification?",
      options: ["Materiality criteria", "Functional criteria", "Resilience criteria", "Stability criteria"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Resilience criteria cover events that could negatively impact the goods or services provided to customers or cause them harm: independent of whether a materiality threshold is crossed. 'Functional criteria' is not one of the four named triggers (reputation, resilience, materiality, stability): a distractor with no basis in the source. Stability criteria concern the wider financial system, not an individual customer-facing disruption."

  summary: `<p><strong>Internal audiences</strong>: risk committee (framework oversight, sets/enforces appetite), audit committee (independent assurance via internal audit, 3rd line), ExCo (board's steering/decision body), central operational risk function (2nd line, aggregator), business line managers (1st line, full daily detail). <strong>Reporting cake</strong>: Tier 1 (business line, full detail, daily) → Tier 2 (ORM committee, action-required only, monthly/quarterly) → Tier 3 (board, high-level only). Comprehensive ORM report: top-10 risks, heatmap/risk register, appetite metrics, KRIs/issue monitoring, events/near-misses, action plans (corrective/detective/preventive, toward a zero objective), emerging risks. <strong>Challenges</strong>: cost-benefit test, event data asymmetry (rare severe events distort averages), escalation needs, small frequent losses (control-gap signal), benchmarking (bp of capital or % of income), asymmetric distribution (use median/quartiles not mean), outliers/scenarios, qualitative aggregation (conversion, categorization, worst-case). <strong>Pillar 3</strong>: qualitative info + 10yr loss history + business indicator (3yr) disclosure; separate notification triggers: reputation, resilience, materiality, stability. <strong>Combined assurance</strong> aligns all three lines (1st: self-assess/attest, 2nd: oversight/deep dives, 3rd: internal audit cycle) into one coherent, color-coded picture.</p>`
