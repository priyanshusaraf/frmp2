  session: "Operational Risk Overview",
  title: "Introduction to Operational Risk and Resilience",
  tagline: "Operational risk is defined by exclusion as much as inclusion: the risk of loss from failed processes, people, systems, and external events — everything that isn't market or credit risk, but still hits the P&L.",

  teaches: `<p>The Basel Committee's formal definition of operational risk, the four-step risk-management cycle that turns that definition into an actual management process (identify → assess → mitigate → monitor), the seven Basel II event-type categories used to classify every operational loss a firm records, the four "extra" risk types operational risk pulls in (legal, compliance, reputational, strategic), the five characteristics that make op risk uniquely hard to manage compared with market or credit risk, and operational resilience — the newer regulatory idea that some disruptions cannot be prevented, only survived, plus the specific guidance issued by the UK, the US Federal Reserve, the Basel Committee, the ECB, and Singapore's MAS.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This reading gives you the classification skeleton that structures the entire book. Every later reading — governance (R41), identification (R42), measurement (R43), mitigation (R44), reporting (R45), capital models (R57–R63) — assumes you already know the seven event-type categories and the five characteristics cold. Understanding WHY op risk is hard (heterogeneous, idiosyncratic, heavy-tailed, interconnected, dynamic) explains why it needs a completely different toolkit than market or credit risk's clean statistical models, and why regulators eventually gave up trying to make banks quantify it with a sophisticated internal model (Basel's Advanced Measurement Approach) and moved to the simpler, more formulaic Standardized Measurement Approach you'll meet in R63.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Market and credit risk have relatively clean statistical structures — prices move up or down, borrowers default or don't, and you can build a probability distribution from decades of price or default history. Operational risk is different: the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) defines it as "the risk or loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, and external events." That's a definition by exclusion — it's everything that can go wrong that ISN'T a market price move or a borrower default: a rogue trader hiding losses, a hacker draining customer accounts, a hurricane knocking out a data center, a clerk fat-fingering a trade, a lawsuit over misselling. It's a genuinely heterogeneous grab-bag with no single unifying statistical shape, which is exactly why it resisted quantification for so long and why regulators eventually settled for a simple, standardized capital formula rather than a model-driven one.</p>
  <p>Operational RESILIENCE is a mindset shift layered on top of ordinary operational risk management: instead of "prevent all disruptions" (impossible for genuine tail events — you cannot stop every hurricane or every zero-day cyberattack), assume severe, infrequent disruptions WILL happen, and make sure the firm's most critical services survive them with acceptable downtime. It's the difference between building a levee to stop every flood and building a house that keeps functioning even when the water gets in.</p>`,

  eli5: `<p>Imagine you run a corner shop. Some things that can go wrong are predictable and small: a cashier occasionally miscounts change, a delivery is a day late, a customer trips and wants compensation — these happen constantly but each one costs you very little. Other things are rare but devastating: the shop burns down, or an employee is caught secretly stealing from the till for years, or a regulator fines you a fortune for selling something you weren't licensed to sell. You cannot manage the small stuff and the catastrophic stuff the same way — the small stuff you just budget for as a cost of doing business, while the catastrophic stuff needs insurance, backup plans, and a "what do we do if this happens" playbook. That messy pile of "everything that can go wrong that isn't a customer not paying you back (credit risk) or the price of your goods swinging (market risk)" is operational risk, and having a plan for surviving the catastrophic version — keeping the shop's essential functions running even through a fire or a scandal — is operational resilience.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager's first job on this reading is classification discipline, not clever math: every operational loss event that happens anywhere in the firm has to be mapped to exactly one (occasionally more than one) of the seven Basel event-type categories, using a documented, consistent rule. The exam setter cares far more about whether you can correctly classify a described event ("a trader deliberately mismarks a position to hide losses" → internal fraud; "a hurricane destroys a branch" → damage to physical assets; "a clerk enters the wrong settlement date" → EDPM) than about any formula, because there isn't one in this reading — the entire module is about vocabulary and taxonomy that gets reused for the next 23 readings.</p>
  <p>Second, think about WHY each of the five characteristics (heterogeneous, idiosyncratic, heavy-tailed, interconnected, dynamic) makes op risk hard, not just what the words mean — the exam likes to give you a scenario and ask which characteristic it illustrates. A trading error that also causes a market-risk loss is testing "interconnected" (specifically the concept of a boundary event). A firm that can't just buy insurance and walk away from its residual risk is testing "idiosyncratic." A distribution dominated by a handful of catastrophic losses is testing "heavy-tailed." Finally, for resilience, think like a regulator: the exam tests recall of WHICH body issued WHICH guidance (UK's FCA/PRA/BoE in 2018, the US Fed in 2020, BCBS's seven principles in 2021, the EU's DORA, Singapore's MAS/ABS in 2021) more than the substance of any one framework, so tag each guidance to its issuer and year.</p>`,

      def: "The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) defines operational risk as \"the risk or loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, and external events.\" An operational risk management (ORM) framework is the complete set of methods and processes a firm uses to control operational risk, run as an iterative four-step cycle: (1) risk identification — finding as many relevant risks as possible, using tools like group brainstorming and staff interviews; (2) risk assessment — determining each risk's probability and severity to prioritize it, using tools like stress testing and scenario analysis, recognizing both probability and severity change over time and by situation; (3) risk mitigation — reducing or eliminating high-probability or high-severity risks via internal controls, insurance, or exposure reduction; (4) risk monitoring — verifying the process is working (reviewing incident reports, tracking key risk indicators); if it isn't, the cycle restarts with remedial action in steps 1–3.",
      intuition: "This four-step cycle is the generic risk-management loop applied specifically to operational risk — it's the scaffolding that R42 (identification), R43 (assessment), and R44 (mitigation) each expand into a full reading.",
      example: "A bank notices a spike in failed trade settlements (identification via incident reports), estimates the probability and dollar cost of continued failures using historical data and a scenario where settlement volumes triple (assessment), rewrites its settlement-matching controls and buys operational-error insurance (mitigation), then tracks a key risk indicator — the failed-trade rate — every month to confirm the fix worked (monitoring).",
      pitfall: "The exam likes to ask which step a given tool (stress testing, scenario analysis, KRI tracking, group brainstorming) belongs to — scenario analysis and stress testing are RISK ASSESSMENT tools, not mitigation or monitoring tools, even though they sound like they belong later in the cycle.",

      name: "The seven Basel II event-type categories",
      def: "Internal fraud — IF (employee defalcation, employees deliberately bypassing internal controls such as rogue trading; low frequency, low severity). External fraud — EF (credit card fraud, hacking losses; high frequency, low severity). Employment practices & workplace safety — EPWS (employee termination disputes, workplace discrimination claims; moderate frequency, low severity). Clients, products & business practices — CPBP (errors that cause client complaints requiring compensation, regulatory fines, misselling, fiduciary breaches; high frequency AND very high loss severity — the single largest contributor to total operational loss severity industry-wide). Damage to physical assets — DPA (weather-related events, negligence, natural disasters, terrorism; low frequency, low severity). Business disruption & system failures — BDSF (IT problems, service interruptions, hardware/software failures, utility outages; low frequency, low severity). Execution, delivery & process management — EDPM (clerical errors, insufficient documentation, data entry errors, failed mandatory reporting; high frequency AND high loss severity — the second-largest contributor to total operational loss severity).",
      intuition: "Every loss event a firm records has to be mapped to one of these seven Level-1 categories per the firm's own ORM policy. Some events genuinely straddle more than one category, but consistency of classification matters more than perfect accuracy — if the firm quietly changes how it classifies similar events from year to year, its loss-history statistics and regulatory reporting both become unreliable. That's why firms perform a comprehensive risk-mapping exercise across every major business process before assigning categories.",
      example: "Based on aggregated bank operational loss data from 2014–2019, CPBP accounted for roughly 52% of total loss severity industry-wide — by far the largest share of any category — followed by EDPM at roughly 27%. Together those two categories drove about four-fifths of all operational loss severity in that period, even though several other categories (external fraud, for instance) occur more often in raw event count.",
      counter: "A widely repeated shorthand claims 'EDPM is high-frequency/low-severity paper cuts, CPBP is low-frequency/high-severity lawsuits.' That pairing overstates the contrast: per the Basel/Schweser category table, BOTH EDPM and CPBP are high-frequency categories — the real distinguishing fact is that CPBP's severity is very high (52% of aggregate severity) while EDPM's is merely high (27%), and the genuinely low-frequency, low-severity categories are internal fraud, damage to physical assets, and business disruption/system failures.",
      pitfall: "Do not assume every category with high frequency has low severity, or vice versa — the exam tests the exact frequency AND severity pairing per category, and CPBP is the one category that is simultaneously high on both dimensions.",
      related: [{ r: 42, label: "R42 — the taxonomy one level deeper (Level 2/3 subcategories)" }],
      memory: "CPBP is the worst of both worlds: frequent AND the single biggest severity driver (52%). EDPM is close behind on severity (27%) despite feeling like small paper cuts individually."
    },
    {
      name: "Legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic risk — the four risk types op risk pulls in",
      def: "Operational risk explicitly includes legal risk and compliance risk, and — on an as-needed basis — strategic risk and reputational risk. Legal risk is the potential loss a firm suffers from the enforcement or nonfulfillment of contracts; most legal risk originates from EPWS events (Type 3) and EDPM events (Type 7). Compliance risk is narrower than legal risk — it specifically means failing to adhere to applicable policies and procedures, and shows up in CPBP events (Type 4); related monetary fines have risen substantially over the past decade, which is why many firms now run dedicated internal compliance departments. Reputational risk is the indirect, subjective loss to a firm's standing that follows a significant operational event (needing both prevention and post-incident management) — though some firms deliberately ACCEPT reputational risk in specific product lines or geographies in pursuit of higher profitability. Strategic risk is losses from either (a) a poor strategic decision or (b) poor implementation of a good strategy; its common denominator is personnel — specifically senior management — so it depends heavily on personnel skill, information reliability, and governance strength.",
      intuition: "These four aren't separate risk types sitting next to operational risk — they're subsets OF operational risk, which is why an ORM framework has to reach into legal, compliance, and even strategic decision-making rather than staying confined to 'processes and systems.'",
      example: "A bank pays a large regulatory fine for inadequate anti-money-laundering controls: that's compliance risk (CPBP event) with a reputational-risk overlay if it makes headlines, and it may also reveal a legal-risk exposure if clients then sue over related contract breaches.",

    {
      name: "Five characteristics that make op risk hard to manage",
      def: "Heterogeneous — a huge range of dissimilar events (from a minor typo with zero loss to a transcription error costing millions) means op risk resists being organized into a single clean statistical model. Idiosyncratic — op risk is diffuse and firm/employee-specific rather than market-driven, so it cannot be centralized or hedged away like market risk; despite strong controls, some residual risk always remains. Heavy-tailed — many small losses (service fees, minor fraud) plus a few catastrophic ones (rogue trading, a widespread cyberattack, an extended IT outage) produce a left-tail-skewed, fat-tailed loss distribution where minor losses can be treated as a cost of doing business but the rare large ones are hard to measure because there's little precedent and no certainty of recurrence. Interconnected — op risk events correlate through shared causes (control weaknesses, human error, macro or political events) and can spill into market or credit risk; an event that starts as one risk type and ends up affecting another is called a boundary event (e.g., a trading error, an operational-risk event, that generates a market-risk loss). Dynamic — the risk profile evolves as business practices and technology change (e.g., rising regulatory fines in recent years, or the shift from manual to electronic banking increasing cyber-fraud losses), forcing risk managers into a more reactive than proactive posture.",
      intuition: "Each characteristic maps to a specific management headache: heterogeneous → hard to categorize; idiosyncratic → can't be hedged away, always residual risk; heavy-tailed → hard to measure the tail; interconnected → hard to isolate and quantify boundary effects; dynamic → hard to model in advance, forces reactive management.",
      example: "A trading error (operational risk) that produces an unwanted open position which then loses money as the market moves against it (market risk) is a textbook boundary event, illustrating the 'interconnected' characteristic.",
      pitfall: "Don't confuse 'idiosyncratic' with 'heterogeneous' — heterogeneous is about the VARIETY of event types, idiosyncratic is about op risk being undiversifiable/unhedgeable and firm-specific, meaning some residual risk always survives even the best controls.",

      name: "Operational resilience and its five elements",
      def: "Operational resilience is how firms and industries anticipate, react to, and recover from business disruptions — a mindset shift from 'prevent all disruptions' to 'assume severe, infrequent disruptions WILL happen; make sure the firm survives them.' Its five elements: business continuity (minimizing disruption to business processes); key (important) services (identifying and protecting the absolute most critical services so they continue with little or no disruption); impact tolerance levels (the acceptable disruption time for a key service, or the time needed to recover from an incident); disruption processes (how the firm responds to disruptions, retains stakeholder confidence, and communicates effectively during them); and feedback (learning from past incidents to prevent recurrence, continually improving the firm's ability to handle unexpected high-impact events).",
      example: "BCBS's 2021 seven principles of operational resilience: (1) governance, (2) operational risk management, (3) business continuity planning and testing, (4) mapping interconnections and interdependencies, (5) third-party dependency management, (6) incident management, and (7) information and communications technology (ICT), including cybersecurity.",

      name: "Regulatory guidance on operational resilience — who said what, and when",
      def: "United Kingdom (2018): the FCA, PRA, and Bank of England jointly added new resilience-specific rules on top of existing ORM regulation, initially focused on continuity of IT services after a cyber incident; COVID-19 in 2020 forced further adjustments for widespread work-from-home (WFH) arrangements handling sensitive transactions in less-secure remote environments. United States (2020): the Federal Reserve published guidance concluding that an effective ORM framework should PRODUCE operational resilience as its overall result — governance is the starting point, ORM is the central element, supported by third-party risk management (supply-chain resiliency) and scenario analysis (anticipating low-probability, high-severity events), with business continuity management and IT systems resiliency as the other two key ingredients, all backed by ongoing surveillance and monitoring. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2021): the seven principles of operational resilience listed above. European Central Bank (2020, proposed): the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), adding harmonized IT-related requirements across EU financial institutions. Monetary Authority of Singapore / Association of Banks in Singapore (2021): guidance on resilience specifically in remote-work settings, covering operations, IT, fraud, legal, and regulatory risk, plus employee education on WFH-era cyber/fraud risks.",
      intuition: "As of the reading's cutoff (May 2022), the UK, US, and BCBS are described as the three KEY regulators with formal resilience guidance — the ECB (DORA, still proposed at that point) and MAS/ABS guidance are important but supplementary.",
      pitfall: "The exam can ask you to identify which regulator is LEAST likely to be a 'key' resilience regulator, or to match a specific detail (WFH focus, IT-service continuity focus, the seven-principle list, DORA) back to its issuing body and rough year.",

The mis-selling lawsuit is clients, products & business practices (CPBP) — also high frequency, but very high severity (≈52%, the largest single contributor).

  quiz: [
    {
      q: "Per the Basel Committee's definition, operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from all of the following EXCEPT:",
      options: ["Inadequate or failed internal processes", "Adverse movements in market prices", "People (e.g., fraud or error)", "External events (e.g., natural disasters)"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "The BCBS definition is 'inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, and external events' — market price moves are market risk, not operational risk. Operational risk is defined partly BY excluding market and credit risk."
    },
    {
      q: "A risk manager runs a scenario analysis estimating the probability and dollar impact of a prolonged IT outage. Which step of the four-step ORM cycle is this?",
      options: ["Risk identification", "Risk assessment", "Risk mitigation", "Risk monitoring"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Scenario analysis and stress testing are risk-ASSESSMENT tools — used to estimate probability and severity for prioritization. A common trap is placing them in mitigation (since they sound forward-looking) or monitoring (since they involve tracking), but they belong to step 2, not steps 3 or 4."
    },
    {
      q: "Based on aggregated bank operational loss data (2014–2019), which event-type category contributed the largest share of total loss severity?",
      options: ["Execution, delivery & process management (EDPM), at ≈27%", "Clients, products & business practices (CPBP), at ≈52%", "External fraud (EF), due to high frequency", "Internal fraud (IF), due to catastrophic single events"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "CPBP accounted for roughly 52% of aggregate loss severity, the largest of all seven categories, followed by EDPM at roughly 27%. External fraud is high-frequency but low-severity, and internal fraud is low-frequency and low-severity, so neither dominates aggregate severity."
    },
    {
      q: "A trading error creates an unwanted open position, which then loses money as the market moves against it before it can be closed. This is best described as an example of which characteristic of operational risk?",
      options: ["Heterogeneous", "Idiosyncratic", "Interconnected (a boundary event)", "Dynamic"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "This is a boundary event: an operational-risk event (the entry error) that spills over into market risk (the P&L loss). That illustrates 'interconnected' — op risk's correlation with, and potential to trigger, losses in other risk categories. 'Dynamic' is the tempting wrong answer because it also sounds forward-looking, but dynamic refers to the risk profile evolving over time with business/technology change, not to a single event crossing risk-type boundaries."
    },
    {
      q: "Which characteristic of operational risk best explains why a firm can never reduce it to zero, even with strong internal controls, insurance, and hedging?",
      options: ["Heterogeneous", "Idiosyncratic", "Heavy-tailed", "Dynamic"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Idiosyncratic captures the fact that op risk is diffuse and firm-specific — it cannot be centralized or fully transferred/hedged away, so some residual risk always remains regardless of controls. Heterogeneous is about variety of event types, not about the impossibility of full elimination, which is the frequent distractor here."
    },
    {
      q: "In 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve's guidance concluded that an effective operational risk management framework produces which overall result, supported by third-party risk management and scenario analysis?",
      options: ["Zero operational losses", "Full regulatory capital relief", "Operational resilience", "Elimination of reputational risk"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "The Fed's 2020 guidance framed operational resilience as the overall RESULT of an effective ORM framework, with governance as the starting point and third-party risk management (supply-chain resiliency) plus scenario analysis (anticipating low-probability, high-severity events) as key supports. Resilience does not mean zero losses (that contradicts the whole point of the resilience mindset shift) or capital relief."

  summary: `<p>Op risk (BCBS definition) = loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, external events — everything that isn't market or credit risk. The ORM framework runs an <strong>iterative four-step cycle</strong>: identify → assess (probability/severity, using scenario analysis and stress testing) → mitigate (controls, insurance, exposure reduction) → monitor (incident reports, KRIs). <strong>Seven Basel categories</strong>, with correct frequency/severity: internal fraud (low/low), external fraud (high/low), employment practices & workplace safety (moderate/low), CPBP (high/very high, ≈52% of aggregate severity), damage to physical assets (low/low), business disruption/system failures (low/low), EDPM (high/high, ≈27% of aggregate severity) — CPBP and EDPM together drive roughly 80% of total severity. Op risk also pulls in <strong>legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic risk</strong>. <strong>Five hard-to-manage characteristics</strong>: heterogeneous, idiosyncratic, heavy-tailed, interconnected (boundary events), dynamic. <strong>Operational resilience</strong>: shift from prevention to survival — business continuity, key services, impact tolerances, disruption processes, feedback — with specific guidance from the UK (2018/2020), US Fed (2020), BCBS (seven principles, 2021), ECB's DORA, and Singapore's MAS/ABS (2021).</p>`
