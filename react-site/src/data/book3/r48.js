  title: "Case Study: Cyberthreats and Information Security Risks",
  tagline: "Pairs a framework overview with the 2017 Equifax breach as the illustrative failure, connect specific control gaps to the generic frameworks named here.",

  teaches: `<p><strong>Information security risk</strong> is broader than "cyber risk": it covers the loss, theft, or exposure of any sensitive information, digital or paper, whether caused by a malicious outsider hacking in, an employee deliberately leaking data, or someone accidentally emailing a spreadsheet of customer Social Security numbers to the wrong address. The reading teaches you to sort every such incident along two independent axes: <strong>internal vs. external</strong> (did the failure originate inside the firm or outside it?) and <strong>intentional vs. unintentional</strong> (was it a deliberate attack/theft or a mistake?), producing a four-quadrant map (an external hacker breaching a server is external+intentional; an employee mistakenly emailing customer data is internal+unintentional).</p>
<p>It then covers three real, named cybersecurity frameworks firms actually adopt, <strong>NIST CSF</strong>, the <strong>CIS Critical Security Controls</strong>, and <strong>ISO 27001</strong>, explaining what each one is, who publishes it, whether it is mandatory, and what it concretely tells a firm to do. It defines the <strong>CIA triad</strong> (confidentiality, integrity, availability) as the three things information security protects, and splits the controls that protect them into <strong>behavioral controls</strong> (aimed at human behavior: training, password hygiene, sanctions) and <strong>technical controls</strong>, which further split into preventive (firewalls, encryption, patching), detective (data-loss-prevention monitoring), and mitigating (offline backups/redundancy) controls.</p>
<p>Finally it walks through the <strong>2017 Equifax breach</strong> in full, concrete detail: the specific software vulnerability exploited (Apache Struts, an open-source web-application framework), the scale (147 million customers), the timeline (breach in March 2017, discovered late July, disclosed to the public September 7), the prior warning signs (an 8,500-item unpatched-vulnerability backlog found in a 2015 internal audit, plus a separate 2016 breach of 430,000 customers), and the five specific institutional failures that let it happen, then draws the exam's central lesson: Equifax did not lack a framework or a policy; it failed to <em>execute</em> one it already had.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Equifax's core failure wasn't a lack of framework: it was failing to EXECUTE a known patch management policy. This is the clearest real-world illustration in the book of the directive-vs-operating control distinction from R44: having a policy on paper isn't the same as an operating control that actually prevents the bad outcome. The reading matters on the exam precisely because it is a worked example: instead of testing you on an abstract definition, it tests whether you can look at a real, messy institutional failure and correctly identify which named control (a patch management policy) existed only as a directive control and never became an operating one.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Equifax had the frameworks and policies in place: the failure was execution. A known vulnerability existed (Apache Struts, rated maximum criticality, a vulnerability score of 10, by NIST), a patch was available, and the patch management POLICY existed on paper (directive control), but it wasn't actually applied across all of Equifax's systems (no operating preventive control). Compounding this, Equifax's own 2015 internal audit had already found 8,500 unpatched vulnerabilities sitting unresolved, and the firm had already suffered a separate breach in 2016 affecting 430,000 customers, so this was not a one-off surprise but a known, recurring weakness that the firm's own governance process had already flagged and failed to fix. This is precisely the R44 lesson: directive controls (policies, training, guidance) tell you what SHOULD happen; preventive/detective controls actually MAKE it happen or catch it when it doesn't. Once the breach began, the failure compounded further: an expired SSL certificate meant Equifax could not properly monitor its own encrypted traffic, so the intrusion went undetected for three months, and when it was finally found, the public communication was slow and poorly handled (customers weren't notified until September 7, nearly six weeks after discovery).</p>`,

      def: "Information security risk is broader than 'cyber risk': it includes loss or theft of paper documents as well as digital data. Every incident can be classified on two independent axes: internal (caused by someone inside the firm, e.g. an employee) vs. external (caused by an outside party, e.g. a hacker), and intentional (a deliberate act, e.g. theft or hacking) vs. unintentional (a mistake, e.g. accidentally emailing sensitive data to the wrong recipient). Crossing these two axes gives four quadrants of incident type.",

NIST CSF is a voluntary, five-step U.S. government framework, originally built for critical infrastructure and later generalized to any business. CIS Critical Security Controls is a continuously updated technical control checklist that firms use to build or review their cybersecurity protocol, complementing NIST or feeding into ISO 27001 certification. ISO 27001 is the key global CERTIFIABLE standard: it gives a checklist of what a firm must achieve, including operating an Information Security Management System (ISMS), rather than direct technical instructions.",
      intuition: "Think of the three as increasingly concrete layers: NIST CSF gives you the big five-step process, CIS gives you the specific technical control checklist to execute that process, and ISO 27001 is the certification you can actually earn (and show a regulator or client) once your controls are good enough.",

Recover: repair and restore impacted equipment/data and keep employees and customers informed.",

  eli5: `<p>Imagine an apartment building whose landlord posts a sign in the lobby saying "All units must have working smoke detectors", but never actually goes unit to unit to check batteries, and doesn't even have a complete list of which units exist. A fire starts in one apartment (started, in fact, right after a "fire-safety upgrade" that itself had a flaw), spreads because nobody notices for months (the building's fire alarm system was also broken and unmonitored), and only becomes public once tenants smell smoke everywhere. The landlord's sign: the policy: was completely correct advice; the failure was that nobody enforced it, tracked what needed checking, or noticed the fire in time. In finance terms: Equifax's written patch management policy (the sign in the lobby) was a <strong>directive control</strong>, but the missing IT asset inventory, unenforced patching, and broken monitoring (the expired SSL certificate) were failures of the <strong>preventive and detective controls</strong> that were supposed to turn that policy into reality.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager reading a cyber case study is not looking for "what went wrong technically": Apache Struts vulnerabilities get discovered constantly, and no framework prevents every zero-day. The question a risk manager actually asks is: <em>at which layer of defense did this firm's controls fail, and was that a policy gap or an execution gap?</em> Equifax is instructive precisely because the policy layer was fine: the gap was entirely in execution (asset inventory, patch enforcement, internal communication) and in detection (the expired certificate blinded them to their own network for three months). A practitioner uses this case to build a checklist: do we know every asset we have? Is our patch policy actually enforced with evidence, not just documented? Can we detect a breach in near-real-time, or would we also go blind for months? Is our crisis communication plan rehearsed, not just written?</p>
<p>On the exam, this framing shows up as scenario questions that describe a firm with a seemingly adequate policy and ask you to identify the actual control gap: the correct answer is almost always "the operating/preventive/detective control was missing or not enforced," not "the firm lacked a framework." Expect matching-style questions on the three frameworks (which one is voluntary vs. certifiable vs. a technical checklist) and quadrant-classification questions using the internal/external, intentional/unintentional typology.</p>`,

      why: "The source figures are $700 million total in fines and compensation, of which $300 million went directly to affected individuals.

  summary: `<p><strong>Three frameworks</strong>: NIST CSF (voluntary, 5 steps: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover), CIS Critical Security Controls (technical checklist), ISO 27001 (certifiable ISMS standard). <strong>Four-quadrant typology</strong>: internal/external x intentional/unintentional. <strong>CIA triad</strong>: confidentiality, integrity, availability; controls split behavioral/technical, with technical further split preventive/detective/mitigating. <strong>Equifax (2017)</strong>: an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability exposed 147 million customers' data; insufficient asset inventory, failed patch enforcement, poor internal communication, an expired SSL certificate (three-month detection delay), and poor public communication were its five failure points; it paid $700 million in fines/compensation. The core lesson: a directive control (policy) without operating enforcement (preventive/detective) is not a real control.</p>`
