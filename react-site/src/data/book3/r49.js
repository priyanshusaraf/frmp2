  title: "Case Study: Financial Crime and Fraud",
  tagline: "AML/CFT is the three-lines-of-defense model applied to knowing your customer well enough to stop criminal money: anchored by the $140 million 2022 USAA fine for weak controls, not proven theft.",

  teaches: `<p>This reading builds a precise vocabulary for financial crime, then tests it against one real case. You will learn: the umbrella definition of <strong>financial crime</strong> (fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing together); the exact Basel Committee definitions of <strong>internal fraud</strong> and <strong>external fraud</strong>, including their sub-categories; the <strong>three lines of defense</strong> as applied specifically to anti-money-laundering / countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), not just operational risk in general; the <strong>customer due-diligence (CDD)</strong> factors and identification documents banks must collect under FATF standards; how a <strong>cross-border banking group</strong> must run AML/CFT consistently across jurisdictions; money laundering's <strong>three phases</strong>: placement, layering, integration: with the actual techniques criminals use at each step (e.g. "smurfing"); the shared <strong>four-control framework</strong> (selection, prevention, detection, deterrents) that both fraud and AML programs are built from; and the <strong>USAA Federal Savings Bank</strong> case: a $140 million fine from FinCEN and the OCC, imposed for control failures with no proven theft.</p>`,

  why: `<p>The USAA case is the cleanest illustration in the book that regulatory penalties can follow from CONTROL DEFICIENCIES ALONE: no proven theft or loss is required. This matters because it recalibrates how you should think about "is our AML program good enough": the bar is control adequacy, not just absence of losses. It also matters for the exam because GARP consistently sets up trap answers that assume a fine must trace to an actual criminal event; knowing the USAA facts cold (five years of gaps, a broken alert system, understaffed review) is what lets you eliminate those traps confidently rather than by guessing.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Money laundering follows a predictable three-phase journey. <strong>Placement</strong> is getting illicit cash into the legal financial system in the first place: for example depositing it through cash transfers, false invoicing, or shell structures like trusts and offshore companies. Because criminals know that a single very large cash deposit trips automatic reporting thresholds, they often use <strong>smurfing</strong>: breaking one large sum into many small transactions (multiple deposits, multiple accounts, multiple people) that each individually looks unremarkable. This is the phase where the money is most physically exposed and therefore the easiest for a bank to catch: cash moving through tellers and branches leaves a visible, structurable pattern. <strong>Layering</strong> comes next: the criminal deliberately runs the money through a chain of complex transactions and accounts, often across jurisdictions, purely to sever the paper trail between the funds and their criminal source. This is the hardest phase to catch, precisely because that is the phase's whole design goal: every extra hop is engineered to make "where did this come from" unanswerable. <strong>Integration</strong> is the last step: the now-laundered money is reintroduced into the legitimate economy: buying real assets, paying "consulting fees," making fake payroll, dividend, or loan payments, so that by the time it surfaces, it looks exactly like ordinary legitimate wealth with no distinguishing trace left. AML controls are strongest and most effective at placement, weakest at layering, and largely irrelevant by integration, which is exactly why regulators focus so much supervisory attention on transaction monitoring at the deposit/onboarding stage rather than trying to trace money after it has already been laundered.</p>`,

Internal fraud, external fraud, money laundering (ML), and terrorism financing (TF) all fall under this umbrella, and all four are also covered by the Basel Committee's definition of operational risk.",

External fraud: 'losses due to acts of a type intended to defraud, misappropriate property or circumvent the law, by a third party': identical intent, but committed with no internal complicity. It splits into theft and fraud (robbery, forgery) and systems security (hacking, stealing information, cybersecurity breaches).",

FATF Recommendation 10 defines a 'customer' as anyone entering a business relationship or an occasional transaction with the bank. Identification/verification documentation includes passports, ID cards, driving licenses, and account files such as transaction records and business correspondence.",
      intuition: "The bank is trying to build a normal-behavior profile for each customer BEFORE the account opens, so that later transactions that deviate from that profile stand out as unusual or suspicious.",
      pitfall: "Banks must also identify/verify persons acting ON BEHALF OF beneficial owners: not just the named account holder. A written declaration of a beneficial owner's identity is allowed but the bank may NOT rely solely on that declaration, and inability to interview the customer in person is never a valid reason to skip identification.",
      example: "Enhanced due diligence is specifically required for accounts with large balances plus regular cross-border wire transfers, and for politically exposed persons (PEPs): especially foreign PEPs: because their public profile and access to public funds raises corruption/bribery risk.",

If the host jurisdiction's rules are stricter than the home country's, the branch/subsidiary must adopt the STRICTER host-jurisdiction rules.

The fine responded to at least five years (2016-2021) of an AML program that regulators said 'willfully' failed to meet Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/AML minimum standards, with inadequate monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity as the bank's compliance program failed to keep pace with its account growth.",

  recall: [
    { q: "USAA Federal Savings Bank was fined in 2022 without any specific proven theft or laundering incident being cited. What does this reveal about regulatory enforcement standards?", a: "It shows that regulators can and do penalize banks purely for CONTROL DEFICIENCIES: failing to meet BSA/AML minimum standards and having inadequate suspicious-activity monitoring/reporting processes is sufficient grounds for a fine, independent of whether any actual money laundering or loss is proven to have occurred." },
    { q: "Why is the 'layering' phase of money laundering considered the hardest to detect, compared to placement and integration?", a: "Placement involves illicit cash physically entering the financial system, which is relatively conspicuous and subject to reporting thresholds. Layering deliberately obscures the funds' origin through complex, multi-step transactions specifically designed to break the audit trail: making it the phase where detection is intentionally hardest. By integration, the funds already appear as legitimate wealth, blending into normal economic activity." },
    { q: "What specific technique do criminals use during the placement phase to avoid triggering AML reporting thresholds, and how does it work?", a: "Smurfing: splitting what would be one large transaction into many small transactions or deposits, each individually below the reporting threshold, so the activity does not automatically trigger regulatory scrutiny." },
    { q: "A bank employee mismarks trading positions to hide losses from risk management, with no outside party involved. Is this internal or external fraud, and why does that classification matter for the four-control framework?", a: "Internal fraud: it is an 'unauthorized activity' committed by an employee (at least one internal party is involved, and it is not a diversity/discrimination event). The classification matters because internal fraud management leans more heavily on the 'selection' control (screening who you hire) and 'prevention' controls like segregation of duties, whereas external fraud management focuses more on detection and law-enforcement partnership against outside criminals." }

  eli5: `<p>Imagine an apartment building whose management company installs door alarms on every unit but then never actually staffs the front desk to respond when an alarm goes off: alarms keep beeping, nobody checks, and the pile of unanswered alerts just grows. When the city inspector shows up, they don't need to find an actual burglary to write the building up: an unmonitored alarm system is itself a violation, because it means the building was never really protected, whether or not a break-in happened to occur. That is exactly USAA's situation: its transaction-monitoring "alarm system" kept firing (eventually tens of thousands of unreviewed alerts), but the staff and training behind it couldn't keep up, so regulators fined the bank for the broken process itself, not for a proven theft.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager reading this case does not ask "did USAA actually launder money for a criminal?": that question is beside the point, and answering it is not the regulator's job in this action. The question that matters is "did the bank's control framework: selection, prevention, detection, deterrents: actually operate as designed, at the scale the business had grown to?" USAA's account base grew faster than its compliance capacity; the monitoring system existed on paper (and even technically functioned, generating alerts) but the humans behind it were understaffed and undertrained, so the control existed in name only. That gap between "we have a policy/system" and "the policy/system actually gets executed" is the single most tested idea across this whole operational-risk study session (see also the Equifax patch-management case in R48): GARP consistently rewards candidates who can distinguish a documented (directive) control from one that is actually operating (preventive/detective).</p><p>On the exam, this framing shows up as scenario questions designed to tempt you into picking an answer that requires a proven loss or a specific criminal act: resist that pull. If the facts describe understaffing, an overwhelmed alert queue, undertrained contractors, or a compliance function that didn't scale with growth, the correct answer is almost always "persistent/systemic control deficiency," not "a specific fraud event."</p>`,

      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "The correct order is placement (funds enter the system) → layering (origin obscured through complex transactions) → integration (funds re-enter the legitimate economy). Any answer that puts integration before layering, or layering before placement, reverses the logical flow: you cannot obscure the trail of money that hasn't entered the system yet, and you cannot spend 'clean' money before it has actually been cleaned."

      q: "A customer makes a series of frequent, small deposits into a business account, each individually below the bank's AML reporting threshold. This behavior is most likely an example of:",

      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "This is the textbook description of smurfing: splitting a large sum into many small transactions to stay under reporting thresholds, which occurs during placement (getting the money into the system). It is not layering, because layering is about obscuring an already-placed fund's origin through complex multi-account transactions, not about the initial deposit pattern. It has nothing to do with PEP status or fake payroll (an integration technique)."

      q: "Under the Basel Committee's precise definition, which of the following would NOT be classified as internal fraud?",
      options: [
        "An employee sharing confidential client information with an outside party",
        "A trader mismarking positions to hide losses",

        "An employee embezzling company funds"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "The Basel definition of internal fraud explicitly EXCLUDES diversity/discrimination events, even though such events involve internal parties. The other three options are textbook internal fraud: sharing confidential data and mismarking positions are 'unauthorized activities,' and embezzlement is 'theft and fraud': both subcategories of internal fraud."

      q: "Within the four-control framework shared by internal fraud, external fraud, and AML programs, know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence belongs to which control?",
      options: [
        "Prevention",
        "Detection",
        "Selection",
        "Deterrents"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Selection is about screening who you let into the relationship in the first place: for AML, that is exactly what KYC does: verify identity and the legitimate origin of funds before or as the account relationship begins. Prevention is about controls that operate once the relationship exists (segregation of duties, risk-based tiering); detection is ongoing monitoring for abnormal activity; deterrents are the consequences imposed after something is caught."

      options: [
        "Apply the home-country's standards, since the group's policies should be applied uniformly regardless of local rules",
        "Adopt the stricter host-country requirements",
        "Apply whichever standard the branch's local management prefers, subject to head-office approval",
        "Suspend AML monitoring at that branch until the group can align both jurisdictions' rules"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "The rule is explicit: wherever a host jurisdiction's requirements are stricter than the home country's, the branch or subsidiary must adopt the host jurisdiction's (stricter) standards. Applying the home standard would let the branch under-comply with local law; letting local management choose the standard contradicts the requirement for a group-wide, centrally coordinated policy; and suspending monitoring is never an acceptable response to a jurisdictional conflict."

  summary: `<p><strong>Financial crime</strong> is the umbrella term (fraud, dishonesty, market misconduct, handling criminal proceeds, terrorism financing) covering internal fraud, external fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing. <strong>Internal fraud</strong> (≥1 internal party; excludes discrimination events; splits into unauthorized activities and theft-and-fraud) vs <strong>external fraud</strong> (third party only; splits into theft-and-fraud and systems security). <strong>Three lines of defense</strong> reapplied to AML/CFT: Line 1 (front office, policy execution), Line 2 (chief AML/CFT officer, independent monitoring), Line 3 (audit). <strong>Customer identification</strong> (FATF): background, occupation, income source, country, product usage, beneficial owners: with enhanced due diligence for large cross-border accounts and PEPs. <strong>Cross-border groups</strong>: consolidated monitoring, group-wide AML officer, stricter-jurisdiction-wins, FATF Rec. 26. <strong>Money laundering</strong>: placement (smurfing; easiest to catch) → layering (hardest to catch) → integration (looks clean). <strong>Terrorism financing</strong>: funding intended for terrorist use, potentially from legitimate sources. <strong>Four-control framework</strong> (shared across internal fraud, external fraud, AML): selection (KYC) → prevention → detection → deterrents. <strong>USAA (March 2022)</strong>: fined $140 million by FinCEN/OCC for BSA/AML control deficiencies ALONE over 2016-2021 (understaffed contractors, ~90,000 unreviewed alerts), no proven theft required, the reading's central lesson.</p>`
