  session: "Operational Risk Overview",
  title: "Risk Identification",
  tagline: "Before you can measure or mitigate a risk, you have to find it — two directions to look (top-down, bottom-up), scenario analysis, and the Basel taxonomy one level deeper.",

  teaches: `<p>This reading is the first of four building blocks in the operational risk management framework (ORMF): (1) <strong>identification</strong> — this reading, (2) measurement and assessment (R43), (3) mitigation (R44), and (4) reporting (R45). Once a risk has been found, a bank has to decide whether to accept it and price/capitalize for it, or reject it and mitigate it — but none of that decision-making is possible until the risk has actually been surfaced. R42 teaches three things: (1) the <strong>top-down</strong> and <strong>bottom-up</strong> approaches to finding operational risks, and the specific tools that live under each; (2) the structured process for running <strong>scenario analysis</strong> and scenario workshops, which turn "what could go wrong" into a defined, assessable list of extreme events; and (3) the Basel operational risk taxonomy pushed one level deeper than R40's introduction — Level 1 (7 broad categories) down to Level 2 (20 specific categories) and Level 3 (concrete examples) — plus the newer ORX taxonomy that restructures it into 14 Level-1 categories.</p>`,

  why: `<p>Combining top-down (strategic/emerging risks senior management sees) with bottom-up (operational detail business units see) gives a more complete picture than either alone — a bank that only does one is structurally blind to an entire class of risk. The exam leans less on memorizing which tool is "top-down" versus "bottom-up" in isolation and more on recognizing what each tool is good at spotting, so you can answer questions like "which tool would the CRO recommend for X" (a real module-quiz question type shown below). Scenario analysis matters because it is the bridge from qualitative risk identification into the quantitative assessment machinery of R43 — a scenario workshop's output (a short list of extreme, plausible, financially severe events) becomes the raw material that gets modeled with fault trees, FAIR, and loss distributions in the next reading. And the ORX taxonomy's elevation of model risk and cyber risk to Level-1 status directly explains why R47-48 (cyber) and R53-54 (model risk) get entire dedicated readings later — those risks earned their own spotlight specifically because they no longer fit neatly as sub-items buried inside a broader Basel Level-1 category.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Top-down identification is like a satellite view — it catches strategic and emerging risks a business unit embedded in daily operations might miss entirely. Bottom-up is like a ground-level walkthrough — it catches the operational detail (a specific process gap, a specific control weakness) that senior management, working at altitude, simply can't see. Neither view alone is complete; the two are complements, not substitutes. Concretely: the top-down approach cascades down three levels — board and senior management, then divisions/business units, then individual business processes — using tools like brainstorming sessions, a "risk wheel," and exposure/vulnerability analysis. The bottom-up approach is not firmwide; it lives inside a specific business unit or process, typically run as part of a risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), and is done by the people actually doing the work — lower and middle management, not the board. Think of it this way: a bank expanding into a new automated financial-advisor product is a risk a satellite (senior management) would spot from altitude — "this is a new strategic direction with IT and conduct risk." But the specific data-entry error pattern in the trade-confirmation process is something only the ground crew (the business unit doing the confirmations) would notice.</p>`,

  eli5: `<p>Imagine a hospital trying to prevent patient harm. The hospital board and chief medical officer periodically step back and ask big-picture questions — "are we expanding into a risky new surgery type, is our IT system aging, is a pandemic coming?" — that's <strong>top-down</strong>: strategic, infrequent, done by people at the top who see the whole landscape but not the daily details. Meanwhile, each ward's nursing staff fills out a checklist every shift noting near-misses — a medication almost given at the wrong dose, a monitor that beeped late — that's <strong>bottom-up</strong>: granular, frequent, done by the people actually doing the work who would never get noticed from the boardroom. Neither the board's big-picture scan nor the ward's daily checklist alone would catch everything; you need both. In banking, "the board" maps to senior management doing top-down risk identification (risk wheel, exposure/vulnerability analysis, emerging-risk scanning), and "the ward checklist" maps to business-unit-level bottom-up tools (RCSA, process mapping, loss/near-miss data analysis).</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager treats identification as an inventory-building exercise, not a one-time event: the goal is to populate the bank's <strong>risk register</strong> (also called the risk inventory or risk universe) as completely as possible, because a risk that never gets identified can never be measured, mitigated, or reported — it just sits there as an unpriced tail exposure until it materializes as a loss. A practitioner asks, for every candidate risk-identification exercise, "which altitude am I working at, and what is this tool structurally blind to?" A risk wheel run in a top-down brainstorming session is good at surfacing causal chains (a weather event triggers a service outage which triggers reputational damage) but will never catch a specific process-level data-entry error — that needs process mapping or RCSA at the bottom-up level. The exam tests this by describing a scenario (e.g., "the CRO wants risk assessed at a more local, detailed level — which tool is he LEAST likely to recommend?") and expecting you to correctly sort the tools into their top-down/bottom-up buckets rather than treating them as an undifferentiated list. On scenario analysis, think like a regulator worried about gameable results: the entire emphasis on neutrality, documented rationale, and structured generation-then-selection phases exists because regulators want scenario outputs that are reproducible and defensible across iterations, not a number a business unit backed into to minimize its own capital charge. On taxonomy, think like an analyst building a mapping table: Basel's 7 Level-1 categories are what regulators require for reporting; the ORX taxonomy's 14 categories are what many banks actually use internally because specific risks (cyber, model risk, third-party failure) had grown too large and distinct to stay buried as sub-items — recognizing WHY a risk gets promoted (its scale/severity outgrew its old home) is more testable than memorizing the list itself.</p>`,

        "<strong>Risk and control self-assessment (RCSA)</strong> — a self-evaluation (by the entire bank, a business unit, or a department) of key operational risks, the controls addressing them, and control strength, typically run by the second line of defense looking at first-line risks, usually annually (and after major risk-profile changes). It measures both inherent risk (before controls) and residual risk (after controls); running it too often turns it into a rote checklist rather than an insightful exercise.",

Basel treats Levels 1 and 2 as the mandatory regulatory reporting categories.",

CPBP losses: infrequent, but very large — driven by client/counterparty disputes and regulatory fines for negligent business practices or breaches of advisory/fiduciary duty; litigation-heavy jurisdictions like the U.S. see especially high severity here.

    { q: "Why is a near miss valuable even though it produced zero dollar loss?", a: "A near miss shows a control weakness was exposed and the only reason no loss occurred was luck, not a functioning control — reporting it lets the bank fix the gap before luck runs out, at effectively zero cost compared to learning the same lesson from an actual loss event." },

Neutrality is achieved through empirical evidence, documented explanations for how/why each scenario was developed, and detailed write-ups supporting the assumptions and methodology used." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Top-down</strong> (exposures/vulnerabilities, risk wheel, emerging risks — strategic view, run by the board/senior management) vs. <strong>bottom-up</strong> (event/loss data, RCSA, process mapping — operational view, run by business units); combine both. Top-down tools: exposure/vulnerability analysis, risk wheel (causal 'cogs'), emerging-risk scanning (predictable via horizon scanning/PESTLE, unpredictable via preparedness). Bottom-up tools: event/loss data analysis (internal, external via ORX, and near misses — zero-cost early warnings), RCSA (inherent vs. residual risk), process mapping (tying controls to risks). <strong>Scenario analysis</strong>: extreme, plausible-but-unlikely events; neutrality via empirical evidence + documented rationale; workshops run generation (brainstorm, silent voting) → selection (combine/drop/add) phases; ~30 scenarios generated, ~half retained for a midsized bank. <strong>Basel taxonomy</strong>: Level 1 (7 broad categories: internal fraud, external fraud, EPWS, CPBP, DPA, BDSF, EDPM) → Level 2 (20 specific) → Level 3 (examples); EDPM small/frequent, CPBP infrequent/large, illustrated by a $30B emergency-funding BDSF example. <strong>ORX taxonomy</strong> (2019): expands to 14 Level-1 categories, promoting third-party failure, statutory reporting/tax, business continuity, data management, information security/cyber, and model risk — directly explaining why these topics earn dedicated readings later.</p>`,

        "Participants should span a full range of seniority levels within different business units",
        "A 'preparation pack' of documents is most commonly withheld until after the generation phase to reduce bias"
      ],
      answer: 3,
      why: "The most accurate statement is that documents are often deliberately withheld from participants until after the generation phase specifically to avoid biasing initial brainstorming. Facilitators are typically operational risk management specialists (not board members); participants are typically upper management (not a full range of seniority); and assumptions rely on empirical evidence plus documented rationale, not exclusively real-life data."

      q: "The ORX taxonomy (2019) expands the Basel taxonomy from 7 to 14 Level-1 risk categories. This expansion is achieved primarily by:",
      options: [
        "Inventing six entirely new risk types that did not exist under Basel",
        "Promoting six specific Basel Level-2 risks (e.g., cyber, model risk, third-party failure) up to Level-1 status",
        "Splitting the existing 7 Basel categories exactly in half",
        "Replacing Basel's regulatory reporting categories entirely, since ORX is now mandatory for reporting"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "ORX promotes specific risks that were previously buried as Level-2 sub-items under Basel's broader Level-1 categories — third-party failure, statutory reporting/tax, business continuity, data management, information security/cyber, and model risk — up to their own Level-1 status. It does not invent new risk types from scratch, does not split categories evenly, and is explicitly NOT (yet) used for mandatory regulatory reporting, which still relies on Basel."

      q: "A bank's execution, delivery, and process management (EDPM) losses and clients, products, and business practices (CPBP) losses typically differ in which pattern?",
      options: [
        "EDPM: infrequent and large; CPBP: frequent and small",
        "EDPM: frequent and small; CPBP: infrequent and large",
        "Both categories show similarly high frequency and similarly high severity",
        "Both categories show similarly low frequency and similarly low severity"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "EDPM losses (data entry errors, transaction miscommunications) occur at high frequency but each event is typically small in dollar terms, driven by financial firms' huge daily transaction volumes. CPBP losses (client/counterparty disputes, regulatory fines for negligent practices) are far less frequent but can be very large, especially in litigation-heavy jurisdictions like the U.S. This frequency/severity contrast is a frequently tested distinction, not the reverse pattern (\"EDPM infrequent and large, CPBP frequent and small\")."

      q: "Why are near misses considered a valuable input to risk identification even though they generate no financial loss?",
      options: [
        "They are a regulatory reporting requirement under Basel Level 1",
        "They reveal a control weakness at essentially zero cost, since the loss was avoided only by luck rather than a functioning control",
        "They automatically get converted into a scenario for the scenario workshop's generation phase",
        "They indicate that the bank's controls are working exactly as designed"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "A near miss means a loss almost happened and was avoided by luck, not because an existing control caught it — so it exposes a real control gap without costing the bank anything to learn about it. It is not a Basel Level-1 reporting requirement, does not automatically feed the scenario workshop, and (crucially) indicates a control WEAKNESS, not controls working as designed — the tempting \"controls are working exactly as designed\" answer inverts the actual lesson."
