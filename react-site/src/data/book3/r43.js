  session: "Operational Risk Overview",
  title: "Risk Measurement and Assessment",
  tagline: "The quant heart of Session 7 — where op risk gets numbers attached. Qualitative assessment, quantitative assessment (FTA, FAIR), the loss distribution approach, and the seven-step resilience process.",

  teaches: `<p>Operational loss data regulatory requirements (how banks collect and classify the incidents they lose money on), qualitative assessment tools (RCSAs, KRIs/KPIs/KCIs, likelihood/impact heatmaps), quantitative assessment tools (fault tree analysis, root-cause analysis, the 5-whys technique, the bow tie diagram, the FAIR model, the Swiss cheese model), the loss distribution approach (LDA) that historically underlay operational risk capital, why extreme value theory has a poor fit for operational risk, how banks combine internal and external loss data, and the seven-step operational resilience process that ties the whole reading together.</p>`,

  why: `<p>This is the reading where op risk transitions from "here is a list of bad things that can happen" (R41, R42) to "here is how you attach numbers to those bad things." The loss distribution approach specifically is the direct ancestor of the SMA (Standardized Measurement Approach) formula that closes the book in R63: the SMA's Business Indicator and Loss Component are essentially a simplified, non-model-based replacement for what LDA tried to do by fitting frequency and severity distributions bank by bank. Even though the SMA now technically eliminates the *requirement* to model operational risk for regulatory capital, banks still use LDA-style thinking internally — for Pillar 2's ICAAP (internal capital adequacy assessment process), for stress testing, and for scenario analysis. So this reading is tested both for its own mechanics (fault tree calculations are a classic numeric question type) and as the conceptual bridge to R63.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Think of this reading as answering four separate questions a risk manager asks about operational losses, in order:</p>
  <p><strong>1. What data do I even have to work with?</strong> Before you can measure anything, you need a clean, complete internal loss database — which is why regulators (the BCBS) set minimums: at least 10 years of history, a €20,000 reporting floor (losses smaller than that are too costly to track individually), and four dates tracked per loss event (occurrence, discovery, reporting, accounting) so you can see how quickly your controls catch problems.</p>
  <p><strong>2. How risky do I judge myself to be, before I run any numbers?</strong> This is qualitative assessment — RCSAs (risk and control self-assessments) where business-unit staff sit down and rate, in their own judgment, "how likely is this risk, and how bad would it be." No math here, just structured judgment turned into a heatmap.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Can I estimate a probability from first principles, without waiting for enough historical losses to build a statistical distribution?</strong> This is quantitative-but-not-statistical assessment: fault tree analysis (multiply the failure probabilities of each control layer that would all have to fail together) and the FAIR model (break a risk into named factors, measure each, and combine them, usually via Monte Carlo simulation). The Swiss cheese model is the mental corrective here — it warns you that FTA's independence assumption is usually optimistic, because real control layers often share a hole (a common vulnerability) rather than failing at random.</p>
  <p><strong>4. If I have enough historical loss data, can I fit an actual statistical model and compute a capital number?</strong> This is the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA). It splits losses into FREQUENCY (how often do losses happen — a discrete count, modeled with a Poisson distribution) and SEVERITY (how bad is each one — a continuous, fat-tailed variable, modeled with a lognormal distribution). You model each piece separately because they have genuinely different statistical shapes and are driven by different things, then you combine ("convolute") them — usually via Monte Carlo simulation, which just means: draw a random frequency, draw that many random severities, sum them, repeat this millions of times, and read off the resulting distribution of total annual losses. The 99.9th percentile of that simulated aggregate-loss distribution becomes the capital requirement — the same 99.9% one-year confidence level used elsewhere in Basel capital rules.</p>
  <p>Fault tree analysis multiplies INDEPENDENT control-failure probabilities together (this is an "AND condition" — every listed control has to fail for the bad outcome to occur) — but real controls are rarely fully independent (they're often designed together by the same team, so a flaw in one design philosophy shows up in several "independent" layers at once), so naive multiplication can dramatically UNDERSTATE the true joint failure probability. The Swiss cheese model captures this better as an intuition-builder (it is not itself a calculation method): imagine each control as a slice of Swiss cheese with holes in it that open, close, and drift around over time. A bad outcome slips through only when the holes in several slices happen to line up at the same moment. The defense is keeping the holes' locations uncorrelated across layers — i.e., designing each control independently enough that a single design flaw can't create holes in the same place in every layer at once.</p>`,

  formulas: [
    {
      name: "Fault tree analysis (independent AND conditions)",
      math: "P(\\text{loss}) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\times P(C) \\times \\cdots",
      plain: "If a chain of control failures must ALL occur together for a loss to happen, and the failures are independent, the joint probability is just the product of each control's individual failure (or pass-through) probability.",
      note: "Phishing 99% × firewall fails 5% × employee fails 10% × detection fails 3% × exit 1% = 0.0001485%. Assumes independence — often unrealistic.",
      derivation: `<p>Worked example straight from the module quiz — a nonmalicious data-leakage scenario with five sequential conditions, each treated as independent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>P(employee receives phishing email) = 99%</li>
        <li>P(firewall fails to block it) = 5%</li>
        <li>P(employee fails to delete/report it) = 10%</li>
        <li>P(detective controls for suspicious network activity fail) = 3%</li>
        <li>P(the leaked information actually exits the bank) = 1%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multiplying under the independence assumption:</p>
      \\[ 0.99 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.03 \\times 0.01 = 0.0000001485 = 0.0001485\\% \\]
      <p>That tiny percentage is a PER-EMPLOYEE, per-period figure. Scale it up: with 50,000 employees at the bank and a consistent failure rate assumption, the bank-wide likelihood of at least one such leakage becomes roughly \\( 0.0001485\\% \\times 50{,}000 \\approx 7.4\\% \\) using a simple linear scaling (the source text's own worked illustration uses a similar scaling logic with different inputs to show that a tiny per-event probability times a large number of employees or transactions produces a MATERIAL aggregate likelihood — the tail-risk-looking number at the individual level is not the risk manager's real exposure).</p>`
    },
    {
      name: "LDA aggregate loss",
      math: "\\text{Aggregate loss} = \\text{Frequency} \\otimes \\text{Severity}",
      plain: "The total operational loss over a period is built by combining how MANY loss events occurred (frequency) with how LARGE each one was (severity) — modeled as two separate distributions and then mixed together (convoluted), not as one single distribution fit to total losses directly.",
      note: "Frequency ~ Poisson(λ); severity ~ lognormal. Convoluted via Monte Carlo. 99.9th percentile of the aggregate distribution = standalone capital requirement.",
      derivation: `<p>Mechanically, Monte Carlo convolution works like this, repeated millions of times to build up the aggregate distribution:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw a random count of loss events for the year, \\( n \\), from the fitted frequency distribution — typically \\( n \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is both the mean AND the variance of the Poisson distribution (its single parameter does double duty).</li>
        <li>Draw \\( n \\) independent random severities \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n \\) from the fitted severity distribution — typically lognormal, chosen because it is continuous, always positive, and fat-tailed (many small losses, a few huge ones).</li>
        <li>Sum them: \\( L = S_1 + S_2 + \\cdots + S_n \\) is one simulated year of total operational loss.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1–3 millions of times to build up the full simulated aggregate loss distribution.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The capital requirement is then read off as the \\( 99.9^{\\text{th}} \\) percentile of that simulated distribution — the loss level exceeded, on average, only once in a thousand years.</p>`

      intuition: "Regulators need enough history and enough completeness that a loss database is actually usable for capital modeling and comparison across banks — a database with 2 years of data, or one that silently drops small losses inconsistently, tells you almost nothing reliable about tail risk.",
      example: "A bank employee manipulates a suspense (transitory) account for years before anyone notices. The gap between occurrence and discovery here can stretch to years — which is exactly why the four-date framework exists: it separately measures how fast a problem is FOUND (occurrence→discovery, a visibility measure), how fast it's ESCALATED once found (discovery→reporting, a timeliness measure), and how long it takes to close out financially (reporting→accounting/settlement, which can itself run three to five years for incidents with legal or regulatory tails).",

KRI measures exposure level (e.g., transactions processed per employee, or an increase in trader transaction limits). KPI measures how effectively the bank operates (e.g., customer complaint count, average IT system downtime). KCI measures how effectively controls operate (e.g., number of overdue business continuity plan reviews, error rates surviving two rounds of independent review).",
      intuition: "These three indicators overlap on purpose — the same underlying control failure can simultaneously be a KRI (it raises the bank's risk exposure), a KPI (it signals the bank is running less effectively), and a KCI (it shows the control itself isn't working). A useful way to keep them straight: KRI asks 'am I becoming MORE exposed?', KPI asks 'am I running WELL?', KCI asks 'is my CONTROL working?' — three different lenses on the same event.",
      example: "A transaction keeps processing incorrectly despite multiple checks, including automated edit checks. The KCI is the inaccurate processing surviving the checks (the control itself failing); the KRI is the increased risk of customer litigation that failure creates; the KPI is what it reveals about weak back-office capability.",
      pitfall: "Backtesting RCSAs against actual incidents tends to reveal UNDERESTIMATED likelihood and OVERESTIMATED severity — a specific, testable directional bias. Heatmaps (likelihood × impact → green/yellow/amber/red) are QUALITATIVE labels, not numbers to be multiplied together. It is mathematically wrong to compare a 'remote × extreme' risk (say, ratings 1×3=3) to a 'possible × low' risk (ratings 3×1=3) as if the equal product made them equivalent — the ratings are ordinal labels, not cardinal numbers.",

      example: "Phishing received 99% × firewall fails 5% × employee fails to catch it 10% × detection fails 3% × information exits 1% = 0.0001485%. Scaled up across 50,000 employees at a consistent per-employee failure rate, that tiny percentage becomes a materially large bank-wide annual likelihood — illustrating why exposure (headcount, transaction volume) matters as much as the raw per-event probability.",
      pitfall: "In reality, controls are RARELY fully independent (they're often designed together, e.g. by the same IT team) — conditional (Bayesian) probabilities give a more realistic estimate, since failure in one control makes failure in a related control more likely, not equally likely.

The bow tie diagram visualizes the result: the risk event sits in the center, with CAUSES and PREVENTIVE controls laid out on the left side (before the event), and IMPACTS plus DETECTIVE/CORRECTIVE controls laid out on the right side (after the event).",

Effective units of measure (UoM) — the loss buckets LDA is applied to — might be external fraud events, internal fraud events per business unit, or processing error events; each UoM should group losses that share similar drivers so they plausibly follow one distribution.",
      pitfall: "Units of measure (UoM) should be homogeneous (similar loss drivers) but homogeneity trades off against data volume — finer UoMs mean less data per bucket, which means less reliable fitted distributions. Copulas (a generalization of correlation) aggregate across UoMs, capturing tail dependence — the tendency for extreme losses in different UoMs to happen together more often than a simple correlation coefficient would suggest. LDA also assumes losses are independent and identically distributed within a class and that frequency and severity are independent of each other — both assumptions are questionable, since empirical data often shows high-frequency/low-severity and low-frequency/high-severity events clustering in ways that violate strict independence.",

Don't assume EVT (so powerful in Book 1's market risk) transfers cleanly to op risk — alternatives like scenario analysis, causal modeling, fixed multipliers, and macro determinants of operational risk are used instead where LDA alone can't handle the very high skewness of the loss data.",

In reality, controls are often designed together and share common vulnerabilities or blind spots (e.g., the same IT team designs both the firewall and detection system) — true joint failure probability, accounting for this correlation, is likely higher than the naive multiplication suggests." },
    { q: "Under the loss distribution approach, why are frequency and severity modeled separately before being combined?", a: "Frequency (how often losses occur) and severity (how large each loss is) are driven by different underlying processes and have different statistical shapes — frequency is discrete and typically well-modeled by a single-parameter Poisson distribution, while severity is continuous and fat-tailed, typically lognormal. Modeling them separately, then convoluting (e.g., via Monte Carlo), captures the true aggregate loss distribution more accurately than trying to fit one distribution to the combined data." },
    { q: "A rogue employee's fraud causes a credit loss when a mismarked position leads to an uncollectible receivable. Is this loss captured in operational risk capital, credit risk capital, both, or neither?", a: "This is a boundary event tied to CREDIT risk — it's treated as credit risk (already captured in credit RWA) and is NOT double-counted in operational risk capital, even though the root cause (mismarking) is operational in nature." },
    { q: "Why does the reading caution that extreme value theory (EVT) is less useful for operational risk than for market risk?", a: "EVT's theoretical justification works best when there's ONE dominant underlying cause generating extreme losses (e.g., market crashes driven by a shared volatility regime). Operational risk losses come from genuinely heterogeneous causes (fraud, system failure, natural disaster, human error) with no single unifying generative process, undermining EVT's core assumption and limiting its practical fit." },
    { q: "What is the bow tie diagram used for, and how does its left side differ from its right side?", a: "It visualizes root-cause analysis around a single risk event placed at the center. The left side lays out the CAUSES of the event and the PREVENTIVE controls meant to stop it before it happens; the right side lays out the resulting IMPACTS and the DETECTIVE/CORRECTIVE controls meant to catch and limit damage after it happens — letting an analyst estimate both frequency (left side) and severity (right side) in one picture." }

  summary: `<p><strong>Loss data</strong>: ≥10yr, €20,000 threshold, 4 dates (occurrence→discovery→reporting→accounting); boundary events tied to credit stay credit, tied to market stay operational. <strong>RCSA</strong> (inherent vs residual risk, qualitative, annual) tends to UNDERESTIMATE likelihood, OVERESTIMATE severity when backtested; alternatives are RCA and RRSA. <strong>KRI</strong> (exposure) / <strong>KPI</strong> (performance) / <strong>KCI</strong> (control effectiveness). <strong>Fault tree analysis</strong>: multiplies independent probabilities — unrealistic since real controls correlate; <strong>root-cause analysis</strong>, the <strong>5-whys</strong>, and the <strong>bow tie diagram</strong> (causes/preventive controls on the left, impacts/detective-corrective controls on the right) dig into WHY and HOW BAD. <strong>Swiss cheese model</strong> captures FTA's blind spot better. <strong>FAIR model</strong>: factors → measure → Monte Carlo combine. <strong>LDA</strong>: frequency (Poisson) × severity (lognormal), convoluted, 99.9th percentile = capital; UoM homogeneity trades off data volume; copulas capture cross-UoM tail dependence. <strong>EVT</strong> poorly fits op risk's heterogeneous causes. <strong>Combining loss data</strong>: scaling, cut-off mix, filtering. Capital modeling now centers on Pillar 2's <strong>ICAAP</strong> since the SMA removed the LDA modeling requirement. <strong>Resilience</strong> (7 steps: IBS → tolerances → mapping → scenarios → remediate → communicate → annual self-assessment) is narrower than BCM.</p>`,

  eli5: `<p>Imagine your house has five separate locks and alarms guarding the front door — a fence, a gate lock, a motion sensor, a door lock, and a dog. If you assume each one works completely on its own and calculate the odds a burglar gets past ALL five by multiplying their individual failure chances, you'll get a tiny, reassuring number. But if the same lazy handyman installed the fence, the gate lock, AND the motion sensor all at once, a flaw in his work could quietly break all three at the same time — so the real odds of a break-in are higher than your tidy multiplication suggested, because the "independent" defenses secretly share a weakness. That's exactly the trap fault tree analysis falls into (multiplying probabilities as if control failures are unrelated) and exactly what the Swiss cheese model is designed to remind you of: your defensive layers have holes that drift around, and disaster strikes only when several holes happen to line up at once — which is more likely than pure multiplication implies whenever the layers aren't truly independent.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A quantitative operational risk analyst treats every "independence" assumption as a claim to be interrogated, not accepted at face value. When you see a fault tree with five multiplied probabilities, the exam wants you to notice two things in sequence: first, compute the naive product correctly (that's the calculation half of the question); second, immediately flag that real controls sharing a designer, a vendor, or an IT platform are correlated, so the true joint failure probability is understated — and remember to check the SCALE of exposure (number of employees, transactions, accounts) before declaring a tiny probability "immaterial," because a tiny per-event chance times a huge exposure base can still be a large aggregate risk.</p>
  <p>When you see LDA, think in two separate modeling jobs, not one: fit a frequency model (how many events this year — Poisson, one parameter doing double duty as mean and variance) and fit a severity model (how big is each one — lognormal, fat right tail) completely independently, THEN combine them via simulation. The examiner will test whether you know WHICH distribution goes with WHICH piece (frequency = discrete = Poisson; severity = continuous/fat-tailed = lognormal), and whether you know the punchline number — the 99.9th percentile of the resulting aggregate distribution is the capital figure, not the mean, not the median. On the resilience side, think like a regulator auditing a bank's self-assessment: is the bank's list of "important business services" actually narrow and prioritized, or did it just relabel its whole BCM plan as "resilience"? The exam rewards knowing that resilience explicitly excludes intolerable impacts (that's BCM's job) and applies only within impact tolerances for a curated list of IBSs.</p>`,

  quiz: [
    {
      q: "A fault tree analysis assumes four independent controls each have a 5% chance of failing simultaneously. What is the probability that all four fail together, and what is the single biggest reason this figure likely understates real-world risk?",
      options: [
        "0.05^4 = 0.000625%; it understates risk because real controls are often designed together and share common vulnerabilities, so failures are correlated, not independent",
        "0.05 × 4 = 20%; it overstates risk because controls usually reinforce each other",
        "0.05^4 = 0.000625%; it is accurate because independence is a safe assumption for bank controls",
        "1 − 0.95^4 ≈ 18.5%; this is the correct joint failure probability under independence"
      ],
      answer: 0,
      why: "Multiplying independent probabilities gives 0.05×0.05×0.05×0.05 = 0.00000625 = 0.000625%, correctly computed under the (optimistic) independence assumption. The distractor at 1−0.95^4 computes the probability that AT LEAST ONE fails (an OR condition), not that ALL fail together (the AND condition FTA actually models) — a common mix-up. The key conceptual point is that real controls sharing a designer or platform are correlated, so 0.000625% likely understates the true joint failure probability."
    },
    {
      q: "Under the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA), which pairing of statistical distributions is standard, and why?",
      options: [
        "Frequency ~ normal, severity ~ normal, because both are symmetric and easy to convolute",
        "Frequency ~ Poisson (discrete counts), severity ~ lognormal (continuous, fat-tailed, always positive)",
        "Frequency ~ lognormal, severity ~ Poisson, reversing the usual convention for market risk models",
        "Frequency ~ generalized Pareto, severity ~ uniform, matching the extreme value theory approach"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Frequency counts whole loss events per year, so it needs a discrete distribution — Poisson, whose single parameter λ is both the mean and variance. Severity is continuous, always positive, and fat-tailed (many small losses, a few huge ones), which lognormal captures well. Swapping them (the 'frequency lognormal, severity Poisson' answer) or using symmetric normal distributions for both ignores the actual shape of operational loss data; the generalized-Pareto/uniform pairing belongs to the EVT peaks-over-threshold method, not standard LDA."
    },
    {
      q: "A bank's RCSA rated a particular operational risk as 'possible' likelihood with 'low' impact, and a separate risk as 'remote' likelihood with 'high' impact. A junior analyst assigns numeric scores (possible=3, low=1, remote=1, high=3) and concludes both risks are equally severe because 3×1 = 1×3 = 3. What is wrong with this reasoning?",
      options: [
        "Nothing — multiplying heatmap ratings is the standard way to compare risk severity",
        "The scores should be added, not multiplied, to get a comparable severity index",
        "Heatmap likelihood and impact ratings are qualitative ordinal labels, not cardinal numbers meant for arithmetic — equal products don't imply equivalent risk",
        "The analyst used the wrong likelihood scale; heatmaps only use three categories, not five"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "The reading explicitly warns that heatmap categories are qualitative labels combined into color zones (green/yellow/amber/red), not numbers to be multiplied together — a remote/high risk and a possible/low risk are not truly equivalent just because an arbitrary numeric encoding produces the same product. The 'add instead of multiply' answer is equally invalid for the same reason. The five-point scales (remote/unlikely/possible/likely/highly likely and low/medium/high/very high/extreme) are standard, so the 'wrong number of categories' answer is factually wrong."

    {
      q: "A mismarked trading position, caused by an employee's operational error, ultimately produces an uncollectible receivable that is booked as a credit loss. How should this boundary event be classified for capital purposes?",
      options: [
        "As operational risk, since the root cause (mismarking) was operational in nature",
        "As both operational and credit risk, to ensure full capital coverage of the loss",
        "As credit risk only — it stays in credit risk-weighted assets and is not double-counted in operational risk capital",
        "As neither, since boundary events fall outside both frameworks by definition"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "The BCBS rule is that boundary events tied to credit risk are classified and capitalized as credit risk (already captured in RWA), specifically to avoid double-counting the same loss in operational risk capital too. Classifying it as operational risk alone, or as both operational and credit risk, would double-count it; boundary events are explicitly covered by classification rules, not excluded from both frameworks (ruling out the 'neither' answer)."
    },
    {
      q: "Why does the reading conclude that extreme value theory (EVT), despite its power in market risk (see R3), has limited practical use for operational risk?",
      options: [
        "EVT requires at least 20 years of loss data, which most banks lack for operational losses",
        "EVT only produces reliable estimates when losses come from one dominant underlying cause, but operational losses arise from genuinely heterogeneous causes (fraud, IT failure, human error, disasters)",
        "EVT cannot be applied to any distribution other than the normal distribution, which never fits loss data",
        "EVT is a purely qualitative technique and cannot generate numeric capital estimates"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "EVT's block maxima and peaks-over-threshold methods are theoretically justified by extreme losses sharing one generative process — a single dominant cause. Operational risk's causes are genuinely heterogeneous, undermining that assumption. The 'needs 20 years of data' claim isn't the reading's stated reason, and EVT is a genuinely quantitative, distribution-fitting technique (ruling out the 'normal distribution only' and 'purely qualitative' answers)."

      q: "What is the key structural difference between the left side and the right side of a bow tie diagram used in root-cause analysis?",

        "The left side shows quantitative data, the right side shows qualitative judgment",
        "The left side covers causes and preventive controls (before the event); the right side covers impacts and detective/corrective controls (after the event)",
        "The left side is used only for market risk events, the right side only for operational risk events",
        "There is no meaningful difference — both sides show the same information for redundancy"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "The risk event sits at the center; causes and preventive controls (aimed at stopping the event before it happens) are laid out on the left, while impacts and detective/corrective controls (aimed at limiting damage after the event occurs) are laid out on the right — letting an analyst reason about frequency levers (left) separately from severity levers (right). It is not a qualitative/quantitative split, nor is it risk-type-specific."
