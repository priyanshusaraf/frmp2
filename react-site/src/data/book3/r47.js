  session: "Operational Risk Focus Areas",
  title: "Cyber-Resilience: Range of Practices",
  tagline: "A survey of how regulators globally approach cyber risk, deliberately non-prescriptive, so the exam tests the categories of practice rather than one 'correct' standard.",

  teaches: `<p>This reading is based on a December 2018 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision report that surveyed how banking regulators around the world actually handle cyber risk. The Committee did not write a single global rulebook. Instead it compared what dozens of jurisdictions (the U.S., EU, U.K., Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, and others) each require, and grouped their practices into recurring categories. You need four groupings: <strong>five areas of cyber-governance</strong> (strategy, roles &amp; responsibilities, awareness, architecture &amp; standards, workforce: who is responsible and how the organization is set up to manage cyber risk), <strong>four areas of cyber risk management &amp; response</strong> (supervision, information security controls, incident response &amp; recovery, metrics: what the institution and its regulator actually <em>do</em> day to day), <strong>five information-sharing channels</strong> (bank-to-bank, bank-to-regulator, regulator-to-regulator, regulator-to-bank, and bank/regulator-to-security-agency: how threat intelligence flows between parties), and the <strong>governance dimensions of third-party cyber risk</strong> (because banks now outsource so much IT infrastructure, cloud hosting, payment processors, software vendors, that a bank's own cyber-resilience is only as strong as its weakest vendor).</p>`,

  why: `<p>Cyber risk was promoted to Level-1 status under the ORX operational risk taxonomy (see R42), meaning regulators stopped treating it as a sub-bullet under "external fraud" or "business disruption" and gave it its own top-level category. That promotion is exactly why this reading exists as a dedicated chapter: cyber risk doesn't behave like a generic operational risk. Losses can be sudden, systemic (one vulnerability can hit thousands of institutions simultaneously, as happened with several supply-chain software attacks), and adversarial: a fraud model or a broken process doesn't actively adapt to your defenses, but a hacker does. Regulators responded with a wave of new supervisory expectations post-2015, and the exam wants you to recognize the recurring shape of those expectations even though no two countries wrote identical rules.</p>`,

  intuition: `<p>Because practices vary so widely by jurisdiction (Hong Kong's guidance emphasizes effective risk management, Singapore's emphasizes detecting attacks, Brazil's emphasizes having a written cybersecurity policy, the EU's emphasizes common procedures and methodologies), there is no single correct answer to "what does cyber regulation require?" So the exam instead tests whether you know the <em>categories</em> regulators look at. Treat this reading like a checklist with four buckets: (1) <strong>governance</strong>: who inside the bank is accountable, from the board down to IT staff; (2) <strong>risk management &amp; response</strong>: what the bank and its supervisor actually do to detect, test, and recover from attacks; (3) <strong>information sharing</strong>: how threat intelligence moves between banks, regulators, and security agencies, and which of those flows are legally required versus purely voluntary; (4) <strong>third-party risk</strong>: because a bank rarely runs all its own IT anymore, what obligations exist around vendors, cloud providers, and sub-outsourcers. Almost every exam question is really just asking "which bucket, and which item within it, does this fact pattern describe?"</p>`,

      name: "Five areas of cyber governance",
      def: "The five areas regulators examine when assessing how a bank organizes itself to manage cyber risk: (1) cybersecurity strategy: does the institution have (or is it required to have) a defined strategy and does it align with the overall business strategy; (2) management roles & responsibilities: board and senior-management accountability, often mapped onto the three-lines-of-defense model; (3) awareness: training, background checks/NDAs for new staff, and a risk-aware culture; (4) architecture & standards: technical controls like content storage requirements and periodic self-assessments; (5) workforce: the skills, certifications, and defined responsibilities of the IT/cyber staff itself.",
      intuition: "Governance answers 'who is responsible and how is the organization set up' before any technical control is even discussed. Regulators check the org chart and the policy documents first, because a bank with no clear ownership of cyber risk will fail at execution regardless of how good its firewalls are.",
      example: "Three distinct regulatory approaches to cybersecurity strategy specifically: (1) the regulator itself sets sector-wide cybersecurity requirements, common in emerging markets with a homogeneous banking system; (2) the bank writes its own strategy, which the regulator then reviews as part of broader risk-management supervision, the dominant U.S./Mexico model; (3) the regulator checks whether the bank's general IT strategy adequately covers cyber risk, without requiring a stand-alone cyber strategy document, common in Europe. Germany's BAIT (Banking Supervisory Requirements for IT) is a concrete named example covering IT strategy/governance, information risk and security management, user access agreements, and IT project management.",
      pitfall: "Do not assume every jurisdiction mandates a stand-alone cybersecurity strategy document. Neither U.S. nor Mexican regulation specifically requires one; both instead review cyber risk as embedded within the institution's broader information security framework.",

    {
      name: "Four areas of cyber risk management & response",
      def: "The four operational buckets covering what a bank and its supervisor actually do about cyber risk day-to-day: (1) supervision of cyber-resilience: regulators trigger reviews from a bank's own self-assessments, inspection findings, or after actual incidents; (2) information security controls: mapping/classifying business assets, real-time threat detection, and penetration testing (a simulated attack used to find exploitable weaknesses before a real attacker does); (3) incident response and recovery: the policies for detecting, escalating, and recovering from an incident once it happens, plus joint public-private training exercises (e.g., G7 exercises, joint U.S.-U.K. drills); (4) cybersecurity & resilience metrics: how progress and readiness are actually measured.",
      intuition: "Read this as a timeline: supervision happens continuously in the background, controls are the preventive layer, response/recovery is what kicks in the moment something goes wrong, and metrics are how everyone, bank and regulator, judges whether any of this is actually working.",
      pitfall: "No standardized quantitative metrics exist yet for cybersecurity, unlike credit or market risk where regulators have decades of loss data and agreed formulas (VaR, expected loss, etc.). Backward-looking metrics (e.g., counting last year's incidents) can be useful when the threat environment is stable, but attackers actively adapt to a bank's defenses, so forward-looking indicators (e.g., trend analysis of vulnerabilities, threat intelligence) are increasingly valued precisely because a low incident count last year says nothing about readiness for a novel attack next year. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, where a single system is flooded with traffic from many compromised sources simultaneously, is the textbook example of an evolving, coordinated threat that a backward-looking metric would miss.",

      name: "Information-sharing channels",
      def: "The five directions cybersecurity information can flow: bank-to-bank, bank-to-regulator, regulator-to-regulator, regulator-to-bank, and banks/regulators-to-security-agencies. The channels differ sharply in how mandated, common, or systematic each one is: bank-to-regulator is usually mandated and one of the three most common; regulator-to-regulator is the least frequent, ad hoc rather than systematic; regulator-to-bank is uncommon with little formal guidance; the full profile of each direction is in the breakdown below.",
      intuition: "The flow of information is asymmetric, not a two-way street with matching obligations on each side. Regulation is far more comfortable compelling banks to report upward to supervisors than compelling supervisors or peer banks to report information back down or sideways. That asymmetry itself is a testable idea.",
      example: "Singapore illustrates that voluntary and mandatory sharing can coexist within one jurisdiction: the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) mandates that banks report cybersecurity incidents to it, but the exchange of cyber risk information between MAS and Singapore's Cyber Security Agency (CSA) is voluntary. In the U.S., banks and regulators can submit cybersecurity information voluntarily through an online portal run by U.S. CERT and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center; Luxembourg has an analogous voluntary portal, the Computer Incident Response Center.",
      pitfall: "Know all five: a frequently tested list where the exam asks which channel is 'usually mandated' vs. 'mostly voluntary' vs. 'rare.' The three MOST COMMON channels are bank-to-bank, bank-to-regulator, and bank/regulator-to-security-agency; regulator-to-regulator and regulator-to-bank are both less frequent because their sharing arrangements are less systematic (ad hoc rather than routine).",

      name: "Third-party cyber risk dimensions",
      def: "The six lenses regulators use to assess a bank's exposure to its vendors and interconnected counterparties: governance of third-party interconnections, business continuity and availability, information confidentiality and integrity, visibility into third-party (and sub-outsourcing) relationships, auditing/testing rights, and resources and skills. Each lens asks a different question about the vendor relationship, from whether an outsourcing framework exists at all down to whether the bank has qualified staff to oversee it; the breakdown below gives the full description of each.",
      intuition: "'Third parties' is broader than just outsourced IT functions. The source explicitly includes cloud computing, but also non-outsourcing dependencies like power supply and telecom lines, plus financial-market interconnections like payment/settlement systems, trading platforms, and central counterparties (CCPs). A bank can be cyber-exposed through a counterparty it never formally 'hired.'",
      example: "The EU's MiFID II directive gives supervisory authority over interactions between institutions, supervisors, and third-party providers, and EU rules may require banks to disclose the physical location of cloud data centers. Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore go further and require the bank retain a contractual right to intervene directly with the vendor if problems emerge, not just a right to audit after the fact.",

  eli5: `<p>Imagine every school in a city has its own rules about fire drills: some schools are told exactly how often to run one by the city fire department, some schools write their own fire-safety plan and just show it to an inspector, and some schools are only checked to see if their general safety plan happens to cover fires too. There's no single citywide fire-drill rulebook, but every school's approach falls into one of those three patterns. That's exactly how cybersecurity strategy works across countries: regulators either (1) mandate the requirements directly, (2) let the bank write its own plan and review it, or (3) just check that the bank's broader IT plan happens to cover cyber risk. There is no single global standard, but a small number of repeating patterns you can recognize.</p>`,

  thinkLike: `<p>A risk manager reading this Basel Committee survey isn't looking for "the rule": there isn't one. They're building a comparison matrix: for the jurisdictions their bank operates in, which of the five governance areas are prescriptive versus principles-based, which information-sharing obligations are mandatory versus voluntary, and where are the third-party oversight gaps. A bank operating across the EU, U.S., and Singapore has to satisfy all three regimes simultaneously, and the fragmentation itself (different reporting timeframes, 2, 4, or 72 hours; different taxonomies; different templates) is a real operational cost the risk manager has to budget for, not just a compliance footnote.</p><p>The examiner tests this by giving you a short fact pattern about one jurisdiction ("Country X mandates sector-wide requirements," "the MAS requires banks to report incidents but sharing with the CSA is voluntary") and asking you to classify it into the right bucket: which governance area, which of the four risk-management areas, which of the five sharing channels, or which third-party dimension. You are almost never asked to recall a country-specific rule from memory; you're asked to recognize which category a described practice belongs to.</p>`,
